// Package oidcfed validates externally issued OIDC ID tokens presented as a
// machine credential (#62, machine-identities ADR § Federation), and owns the
// server-side JWKS cache with its bounded staleness window.
//
// It is a sibling of internal/oidcrp, not an extension of it, and the split is
// deliberate: oidcrp is a RELYING PARTY — it runs an authorization-code flow,
// holds a client id and secret, and validates a token it asked for. Federation
// has no flow, no client secret and no redirect: a workload arrives holding a
// token some platform minted for it, and the only questions are whether the
// signature is genuinely that issuer's and whether every pinned claim matches.
// Sharing one type would have meant one struct with two disjoint halves.
//
// What this package does NOT do: hand-roll any JWT or signature verification.
// go-oidc performs the whole cryptographic check against keys this package
// fetched and cached; go-jose parses the JWKS document into public keys and
// reads the unverified header for cache maintenance. The human-auth ADR's
// no-hand-rolled-primitive invariant governs federation unchanged.
