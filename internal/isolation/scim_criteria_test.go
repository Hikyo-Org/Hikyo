// The SCIM acceptance-criteria matrix (#73, SC1–SC4).
//
// The ADR's fixture discipline is normative and self-enforcing: "each fixture
// names the §-clause it proves; a clause without a fixture is a CI failure of
// the criteria matrix itself — no catch-all 'full conversation' rows." This
// file is that CI failure.
//
// Two properties are checked, and they fail in OPPOSITE directions on purpose:
//
//  1. every clause in the closed list below has at least one fixture, so a
//     clause cannot be quietly unimplemented;
//  2. every fixture NAMED here exists in this package's source, so the matrix
//     cannot be satisfied by naming a test that was renamed or deleted.
//
// The registry is STATIC rather than accumulated at run time. A run-time
// registry would make the completeness check depend on test ORDER and would
// pass vacuously under `go test -run` filters, which is exactly when somebody
// is most likely to be looking at it.

// scimClause is one acceptance-criteria clause with the fixtures proving it.
type scimClause struct {
	// Text is the clause as the ADR words it, so a reader comparing this table
	// to the ADR is comparing sentences rather than guessing at abbreviations.
	Text string
	// Fixtures are Go test or helper function names in this package.
	Fixtures []string
	// Blocked names the ticket a clause cannot be proved without. A clause with
	// a Blocked reason is NOT COVERED, and the matrix says so rather than
	// pointing at a tripwire that asserts the behaviour is absent: a passing
	// test whose own subject is "this does not work yet" is not evidence the
	// clause holds, and letting it satisfy the matrix is how a completeness
	// check turns into a completeness claim.
	Blocked string
}

// scimCriteria is the closed matrix. IDs are stable: SC<row>.<letter>, assigned
// in the order the ADR's acceptance table words them. An ID is never reused for
// a different clause — a renumbered matrix would silently re-point a fixture at
// something it does not prove.
