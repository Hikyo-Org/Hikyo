// Package admission is the pre-authentication admission control the threat
// model requires and the ops spec dimensions: an instance-wide semaphore over
// Argon2id execution, a bounded queue, per-source-IP rate limiting, and
// per-account backoff.
//
// Why instance-wide and not just per-account/per-IP: a distributed attempt
// spread across many usernames and many source IPs never trips either bucket,
// while each accepted attempt consumes 64 MiB of memory and a durable audit
// write. Per-account and per-IP backoff is necessary and insufficient, so
// both exist here.
//
// Deliberately in memory, not in the database. v1's locked deployment
// envelope is a single node with no HA, so process-local state is the whole
// instance's state; a durable throttle table would add a write per failed
// attempt — amplifying exactly the flood it is meant to bound — to buy
// nothing this deployment shape can use. A multi-node build must replace this
// with shared state, which is why the constraint is written down here rather
// than discovered later.
