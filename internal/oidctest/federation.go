// The three issuer SHAPES federation must be exercised against (#62,
// machine-identities ADR § Federation: "one mechanism covers Kubernetes
// projected ServiceAccount tokens, Forgejo Actions and GitHub Actions").
//
// They are real shapes, not placeholders, and that is the point of having three:
// the subject grammar, the claim vocabulary and the DEFAULT AUDIENCE differ per
// platform, and every one of those differences is a rule the binding has to
// carry. A single synthetic shape would have made the CI `event_name` rule and
// the default-audience refusal look like arbitrary policy rather than the
// specific defences they are.
//
// Each shape provides two halves that must agree: the claims a token carries,
// and the claims a correct binding pins. A fixture that built only the first
// would let a binding pin claims no issuer emits and still pass.

// Shape is one issuer's token vocabulary.

	// Subject is the `sub` the platform mints, byte-exact.

// KubernetesShape is a projected ServiceAccount token, in the claim shape a real
// cluster actually mints.
//
// The subject grammar is `system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<name>`, and it is
// the whole reason the ADR forbids pattern bindings: a rule such as "any
// ServiceAccount in namespace prod" hands a Hikyo principal to anyone holding
// `create serviceaccount` in that namespace — a far wider group than
// cluster-admin.
//
// EVERYTHING PLATFORM-SPECIFIC IS NESTED under the single literal top-level claim
// `kubernetes.io`, and this fixture mints exactly that. An earlier version
// invented flattened scalars (`kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/uid` as a top-level
// key) that Kubernetes never emits — which made the tests pass against a token
// shape no cluster produces, and left the real UID unpinnable. The pins are
// therefore JSON Pointers into the nested document.
//
// The UID is what the ADR's immutable-identifier rule means here: a UID is
// immutable per object, so a ServiceAccount deleted and recreated with the same
// name has a different one. Pinning the name alone would let the replacement
// inherit the binding.
//
// DefaultAudience is the API server's, and it is operator-supplied in reality —
// whatever that cluster was configured with — which is why the issuer
// configuration carries the refused list rather than deriving it.

// ForgejoShape is a Forgejo Actions token.

// The subject is `repo:<repository>:ref:<ref>` for every event EXCEPT an exact

// branch's subject, the one a production binding names — and Forgejo documents
// that a `pull_request_target` workflow with `enable-openid-connect` touching
// untrusted pull-request content may leak the ID-token request credentials. A
// crafted pull request against such a workflow therefore yields a token bearing
// the bound production subject. The protection is the pinned `event_name`.

// owner has, so accepting it makes any workflow in any of their repositories
