// Password policy (human-auth ADR § Credential storage): a length floor of
// 12, no composition rules, no forced rotation — the NIST SP 800-63B shape —
// with rejection against a bundled common-password list.
//
// Composition rules produce `Password1!` and a false sense of entropy;
// forced rotation produces `Password2!`. Neither exists here and neither
// should be added.
//
// The list is checked AT SET TIME ONLY, never at login. Checking at login
// would put a variable-cost lookup on the timing-sensitive path for no
// benefit: the password was already refused when it was set.

// commonPasswords is the bundled list.
//
// STATED GAP: the ops spec calls for the embedded top-100k (SecLists/HIBP-
// derived), pinned and hash-checked in CI. What ships here is a starter set,
// because sourcing the full list needs a network fetch and a licence review
// that this ticket did not do. The MECHANISM is complete and on the right
// path; the DATA is not, and TestCommonListIsAKnownPlaceholder fails the day
// someone mistakes one for the other.
