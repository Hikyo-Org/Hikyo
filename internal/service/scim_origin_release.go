// The §2.4 universal release algorithm (#73, scim-provisioning ADR).
//
// ONE algorithm governs every SCIM-side origin release, whatever triggered it —
// user deprovision or delete, group membership removal, group delete, mapping
// row delete or narrowing, binding delete: release the named `scim` origins;
// revoke rows whose last origin that was; advance the affected principals'
// session generations in the same transaction; emit the audit events.
//
// The one place it bends is the lockout interplay, and it bends by CONVERTING
// rather than refusing. The locked refusal — removing the last org
// `manage-members` holder is refused — binds HUMAN revocation unchanged. Here
// a refusal would wedge the IdP into infinite retry while the departed user
// kept all their access, so the `scim` origin is released (origin truth stays
// honest: the IdP did withdraw it) and a `lockout-retention(cause)` origin is
// minted on the same row in the same transaction.

// ErrSCIMOriginOnly refuses a HAND revocation of a grant whose only live
// origins are system-owned, naming the two real remediations (ADR §4).
//
// Before this ticket such a revoke fell through to ErrNoSuchGrant, which is a
// different statement: "you do not hold that" versus "you hold it, and this is
// not the lever that removes it". An administrator told the first would go
// looking for a grant that is right there on the membership line.
