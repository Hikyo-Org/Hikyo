// The machine fetch surface and its conditional cursor (#62, machine-identities
// ADR § Authentication, authorization and the fetch path; revision-model ADR §
// Revision identity as amended by the schema-model ADR).
//
// WHAT IS DELIVERED, stated first because it bounds everything below. A fetch
// delivers the authorized projection of the addressed environment's committed
// snapshot: each key's name, classification, presence, and — where the caller
// is authorized to receive it — its PLAINTEXT value. The per-key value rule is
// evaluated server-side, in-transaction, from the grant rows already loaded: a
// `config` value crosses under `read`, a `secret` value under `read ∧ reveal`
// (or `read ∧ reveal-history` for a pinned non-current revision), and a secret
// the caller may not reveal arrives presence-only with no value. That is the
// surface #63 (Compose) and #64 (the Kubernetes operator) consume to converge
// their delivery targets: a value moving changes the change token and therefore
// fires the consumer's rollout.
//
// THE CURSOR IS BOUND TO MORE THAN CONTENT ALONE, and the ADR's
// reasoning for each is in internal/delivery. The mechanism here is deliberately
// the dullest one that works: the server recomputes the cursor for the state it
// is about to serve and compares it to the one presented. A match means
// "current"; anything else means a full authorized delivery. There is no cursor
// decoding, no cursor versioning, and no upgrade path to maintain — which is
// exactly what makes replacing the manifest computation safe when real revisions
// land, because every outstanding cursor mismatches once and every caller
// re-syncs.

// FetchResult is one machine fetch.
type FetchResult struct {
	// Current reports that the presented cursor named the state the server was
	// about to serve. NO CONTENT accompanies it — that is the whole point: only
	// a fetch that actually delivers is a disclosure.
	Current bool
	// Cursor is the opaque cursor for the state this answer describes. It is
	// returned on BOTH dispositions: a caller told "current" must be able to
	// keep polling without having to re-fetch to learn its own cursor.
	Cursor string
	// ChangeToken is the keyed delivery-manifest token, `v1:`-prefixed. It is
	// change-detection material ONLY — the conditional-fetch cursor's input —
	// and is never itself a workload-visible value (k8s ADR § Declared
	// amendment): what reaches a pod annotation is the consumer's client-side
	// per-target keyed stamp, not this token. It is non-secret metadata by
	// construction (keyed, not a digest of content), so it may flow into logs
	// and change-detection caches.
	ChangeToken string
	// CredentialExpiresAt is the presenting credential's expiry when finite
	// (bearer credential `expires_at`; federated binding expiry), and the zero
	// time for an indefinite credential. The operator surfaces it as the ADR's
	// ahead-of-time expiry condition.

	// PinExpired is a loud status condition only. Expiry ends retention
	// protection; it never changes delivery while the payload survives.
	PinExpired bool
	// CredentialID is the authenticated caller's immutable credential id. It is
	// returned on BOTH dispositions because clients bind it into snapshot AAD
	// and offline disclosure records rather than guessing their wire identity.
	CredentialID string
	// IssuedAt and SnapshotExpiresAt are server assertions bound into the
	// client's offline-snapshot AAD. They are present on both dispositions;

//     covers. Under `config-only` the manifest carries CONFIG keys only, so the
//     token a config-only consumer holds is stable across secret rotations it
//     was never meant to see.
//   - The KEYS the caller receives carry plaintext only where the caller is
//     authorized: config under `read` (already held), secret under
//     `holds(reveal)` — or `holds(reveal-history)` for a pinned non-current
//     revision — and otherwise presence-only. Under `config-only`, secret keys
