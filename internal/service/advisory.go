// The live-update advisory channel (revision-model ADR § Live updates;
// system-architecture ADR § Real-time, which fixes SSE as the transport and
// requires a documented polling fallback).
//
// FOUR CONSTRAINTS, all binding, all held here rather than at the transport:
//
//  1. METADATA ONLY. An event says that something changed, never what it
//     changed to. It carries no value in any form and NO CHANGE TOKEN -- the
//     token is derived from a keyed secret and is change-detection material for
//     the workload path, not chatter for a browser channel. AdvisoryEvent has
//     no field that could hold either, which is the cheapest way to keep the
//     rule.
//
//  2. AUTHORIZED PER EVENT AND PER REFERENCED OBJECT, projected per recipient.
//     Checking that the subscriber may view the project is not enough: a user
//     with `dev` but not `prod` would otherwise learn that prod exists, which
//     keys it holds and when it changed. Every event is authorized against the
//     environment it names, inside a transaction, at emit time -- so a grant
//     revoked mid-session bites on the NEXT event, not at the next reconnect.
//
//  3. ADVISORY ONLY. Correctness never depends on delivery. The serialized
//     publish and the version-id freshness check are the authority; a client
//     that missed every event still cannot publish a stale change. That is what
//     makes dropping a slow subscriber (below) a safe thing to do rather than a
//     correctness bug.
//
//  4. NO REPLAY. Nothing is retained for `Last-Event-ID`; a reconnecting client
//     performs a normal authorized refetch. Retaining event history would be a
//     second audit log with weaker rules.
//
// THE POLLING FALLBACK is Revisions.Signals: the same facts, pulled under the
// caller's own authorization. It is not a degraded mode bolted on for proxies
// -- it is the matrix's ordinary read, and the stream only saves it a poll.

// advisoryBuffer bounds one subscriber's queue. A client that cannot keep up is
// DROPPED rather than buffered without limit: the events are advisory, the
// client refetches on reconnect, and an unbounded per-connection buffer is a
// memory-exhaustion primitive any authenticated principal could trigger by
// opening a stream and not reading it.
