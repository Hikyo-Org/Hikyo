// The flat value model (#50, flat-model ADR + encryption-model ADR + the locked
// permission-model formula table).
//
// A Value attaches to a `(key, environment)`. There are no other layers, so
// RESOLUTION IS A LOOKUP: a key in an environment is that environment's `set`
// entry, or it is unresolved. Nothing is inherited, nothing defaults, and
// there is no third presence state — `masked` was deleted with the graph it
// existed to explain, and it has no representation in this file, the store,
// the API or the CLI.
//
// The ergonomics inheritance used to provide are three EXPLICIT operations,
// each independent and each producing values with no ongoing relationship to
// their source:
//
//   - Declare-into-environments (Declare) — the caller SUPPLIES one plaintext
//     and it lands in several environments at once.
//   - Copy-to / bulk-apply (Copy) — the server duplicates STORED material into
//     chosen destinations. One key or many, one destination or many; the ADR's
//     "copy-to" and "bulk apply" are the same operation over different sized
//     inputs, so they are one method.
//   - Clone-at-creation (Environments.Clone) — the same duplication, with the
//     destination being an environment that does not exist yet.
//
// The difference that MATTERS is not how many cells move: it is whether the
// actor supplied the plaintext. Supplied material needs no `reveal` (they
// already have it — they typed it). Server-side duplication is "authorized
// duplication, never supply" and carries the locked formula in full:
// `reveal(source)` ∧ `reveal(destination)` ∧ `publish(destination)`.

// valueFieldTag is the AAD's field tag for the value column. One column, one
// tag; a second sealed column on this row would take its own.
const valueFieldTag = "value"

// MaxPendingPerProject is the ops-spec § 8 loud cap on pending versions per
// project. Per-user working state is separately UNIQUE per (user, project,
// env, key) by the pending_changes constraint; this bounds the project-wide
// total so a script cannot flood the draft space.

// The copy-operation labels for the audit trail: which ergonomic operation a
