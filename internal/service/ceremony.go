// The disclosure ceremony (#58, permission-model ADR § The reveal guard,
// locked prototype #21 `prototype/reveal-edit/`, approach a).
//
// #50 gave the value surface its CAPABILITY half: `read(E)` ∧ `reveal(E)` and
// one audit event per disclosed key. This file adds the second half the ADR
// puts in front of it — "a sliding reauthentication window, configured per
// environment under `project-settings`, where `0` means every disclosure" —
// and it is deliberately a THIN adapter over machinery that already exists:
// `Auth.ConsumeReauthWindow` (#54) is the window's consumption rule, this is
// only the seam that calls it at the value surface.
//
// Three ADR invariants are load-bearing here and are stated so a later edit
// cannot lose them by accident:
//
//  1. **The window gates the reauthentication PROMPT, never the authorization
//     check.** Every gate call below runs AFTER `authorize()` has already
//     produced a proof, inside the disclosure's own transaction. A revoked
//     `reveal` therefore stops revealing on the next cell even inside an open
//     window, because the capability check ran first and failed first.
//  2. **The gate covers every route in the formula table**, not only the
//     matrix cell: cell reveal, bulk reveal, diff reveal, and both ends of a
//     copy. The two ends are gated differently, and the difference is the ADR's
//     not this file's: the SOURCE is a disclosure and always takes the ceremony;
//     the DESTINATION takes it when it is PROTECTED, which is where the ADR puts
//     protected-environment confirmation and where the locked prototype puts the
//     publish-into-protected ceremony. A non-protected destination stays
//     capability-only — its `reveal` conjunct is checked at the chokepoint like
//     any other, and inventing a prompt there would train people to click through
//     the one that matters.
//  3. **Reauthentication does not apply to machine identities** — "the token
//     IS the credential and there is no second factor to re-present". A
//     machine identity carries no session id, which is what `skipsCeremony`
//     reads. It is a structural fact, not a policy flag someone can flip.
//
// The enumerated unit is `(environment, sorted key ids)`, matched byte-exact
// against the ceremony's pinned binding for a single-decision (0-window,
// protected) ceremony. That is the prototype's "one decision over exactly the
// keys below" made checkable: a passkey assertion authorizes those keys in
// that environment and nothing else, and it is spent by exactly one decision.

// ErrNoCeremonySeam is a wiring fault, never a caller's problem: a value
// surface built without an Auth cannot run the reveal guard, and a disclosure
// surface with a missing guard must refuse loudly rather than disclose.
var ErrNoCeremonySeam = errors.New("service: the value surface has no reauthentication seam wired")

// skipsCeremony answers the ADR's machine exemption structurally.
//
// A machine identity has no session row (`authz.Identity.SessionID` is empty
// for one, by that type's own documented contract), so it has nothing a window
// could hang off. Local host authority — break-glass — is in the same position
// and is likewise the one path the ADR says is not evaluated against a grant.

//
// The intent carries the disclosure's variant, environment and enumerated
// keys as one value. The keys are exactly the set the ceremony modal enumerates
// and the set that will emit disclosure events, so the three cannot drift.
//
// An empty key set is NOT a free pass: it is a disclosure of nothing, and a
// disclosure of nothing needs no ceremony. Callers reach here only when there
// is `secret` material in play, so this is a guard against a caller that asked
// for a gate it does not need rather than a hole.
