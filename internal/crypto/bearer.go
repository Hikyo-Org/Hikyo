//
// The type list that ADR fixes already names the human artifacts this slice
// mints — `cli` for a CLI session and `bs` for a bootstrap authority — so
// there is one grammar, one scanner rule, and the audit package's existing
// `hik_` redaction filter covers these values for free. Minting a second,
// unfiltered grammar for human artifacts would have been strictly worse.
//
// Normative, restated because it is the part that is easy to lose: the
// server trusts NOTHING inside the value. Kind, principal, expiry and
// credential epoch are read from the row the verifier resolves to. The prefix
// is a hint for humans and for secret scanners; the checksum lets a CLI or a
// leak scanner reject a truncated or mistyped value with zero server calls.

// ArtifactType is the `type` field of the token grammar.
