// The flat value model's storage shapes (#50, flat-model ADR).
//
// A ValueEntry is one `(key, environment)` cell that is `set`. There is no
// presence field and no `absent` row: PRESENCE IS THE ROW'S EXISTENCE, and the
// deleted `masked` state has no representation anywhere in this package. That
// is not a shortcut — it is what makes "no fallback source exists" a property
// of the schema instead of a promise the service layer has to keep.
//
// This package never sees plaintext. Ciphertext arrives sealed by the caller
// under the project DEK and leaves sealed; the AAD that binds it to this row
// is the service layer's to build, from the same columns stored here.

// ValueEntry is a stored value cell.
