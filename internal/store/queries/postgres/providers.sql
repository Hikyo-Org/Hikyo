-- OIDC provider administration (#54, human-auth ADR - Login methods). The
-- provider table is class=authn: it decides how a caller may authenticate, and
-- login resolves it proof-free, so every statement touching it lives on the
-- resolution surface. Provider mutations are still authorized at the chokepoint
-- (OpProviderPut/Delete under instance-config) before these run; the write
-- itself rides the resolution surface, like the session lifecycle.
