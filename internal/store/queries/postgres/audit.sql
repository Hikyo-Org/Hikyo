-- Audit trails (#45): the application layer holds INSERT and SELECT only on
-- both audit tables - the append-only CI invariant scans this file. The
-- reserved chain_* parameters are bound by the store's binding layer (and,
-- for the denial writer, by the authorization package's enumerated surface)
-- from resolved chains only - never from caller arguments.
--
-- Query page order is seq (allocation order). Export pages use commit_seq,
-- assigned by the deferred commit appender in migration 00010; the public
-- after_seq filter remains a seq lower bound.
