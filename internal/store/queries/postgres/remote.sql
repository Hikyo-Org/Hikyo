-- The authentication read. One indexed lookup on the unsalted SHA-256

-- constant-time compares the returned verifier and runs the miss path's decoy
-- work, so unknown / revoked / expired / live are work-shape uniform.
--
-- The predicates that decide LIVENESS are deliberately not in this WHERE
-- clause. Filtering here would make an unknown credential cost one row and a
-- revoked one zero, which is a query-count oracle for which credentials exist.
