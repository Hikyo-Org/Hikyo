-- The operator's commit covers `manual` origins ONLY (#73, scim-provisioning
-- ADR section 9.1). A restored `scim` origin is a claim about what an identity
-- provider asserted BEFORE the backup was taken, and the whole point of the
-- rule is that the restore must not re-activate it: the IdP's own next
-- re-assertion recreates SCIM origins from live truth, so a user it no longer
-- asserts is never re-authorized, not even for a window.
--
-- `structural` and `lockout-retention` survive deliberately. A structural
-- origin holds a provisioning connection's own grant and is created with the
-- binding, not by the identity provider, so nothing would ever recreate it; a
-- retention exists precisely to keep an org administrable, and dropping it at
-- restore would lock out the org the moment it most needs administering.
--
-- ARCHIVED, not merely `scim`. The reconciliation commit refuses archived
-- truth; it does not get to destroy LIVE truth. A restore leaves every
-- principal inert, but the operator reconciles the binding's provisioning
-- connection first (that is the only way the wire comes back), so the identity
-- provider's next cycle can assert something new about a user who is still
-- unreconciled. Those origins are current truth. Filtering on kind and
-- principal alone dropped them with the archived ones, and the originless
-- cleanup below then deleted grants the IdP was asserting right then --
-- access lost until the next cycle, roughly forty minutes later, for a user
-- whose authority never lapsed.
--
-- Provenance is `created_at` against `auth_instance_state.reactivated_at`, the
-- instant the restored instance came back. It is #76's own anchor, used the
-- same way the machine-identities ADR uses it for the federated `iat` floor: a
-- row stamped at or before the restore came out of the archive, a row stamped
-- after it was written by this instance since. NULL means this datastore was
-- never restored, the comparison is NULL, and the statement matches nothing --
-- which is right, because a reconciliation with no restore behind it has no
-- archived rows to refuse. The boundary is `<=` rather than `<` so an
-- ambiguous stamp is treated as ARCHIVED: dropping a live origin costs one
-- IdP cycle, re-activating an archived one is the security failure this rule
-- exists to prevent.
