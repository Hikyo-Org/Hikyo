-- OIDC provider administration (#54, human-auth ADR - Login methods). The
-- provider table is class=authn: it decides how a caller may authenticate, and
-- login resolves it proof-free, so every statement touching it lives on the
-- resolution surface. Provider mutations are still authorized at the chokepoint
-- (OpProviderPut/Delete under instance-config) before these run; the write
-- itself rides the resolution surface, like the session lifecycle.

-- since Phase A, so the mint must refuse (the A4 sweep always wins the TOCTOU).
-- A matching row takes the lock, so a concurrent provider-change UPDATE
-- serializes behind it (and vice-versa: whichever commits first, the other's
-- guard sees the bumped row_version and fails). The no-op never bumps
-- row_version, so it never spuriously fails an administrator's reconfigure CAS.
