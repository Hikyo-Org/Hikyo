-- OIDC federation (#62, machine-identities ADR section Federation). Issuer
-- configuration is instance-scoped; a federated binding is a row of
-- machine_credentials under the credential-kind discriminator, so its
-- statements live beside the credential ones on the resolution surface for the
-- same reason: a machine credential resolves at the chokepoint that mints the
-- proof, so it cannot be read from behind one.

-- Refusing only on LIVE bindings would leave the historical rows pointing at an
-- issuer that no longer exists, so the trail could no longer answer what a past
-- binding trusted -- and the foreign key would refuse the delete anyway, with a
-- driver message instead of an explanation. An operator who really wants the

-- Like the verifier read it returns the row unconditionally rather than
