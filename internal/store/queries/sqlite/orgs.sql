-- The Org aggregate. Creation, listing and counting are instance-scoped
-- operations (they are cross-tenant by definition: a create has no parent
-- tenant and an enumeration spans all of them); each is annotated and
-- content-pinned in the allowlist fixture (tenant-isolation ADR invariant 13).
--
-- The by-id statements are NOT annotated: an org row is its own tenant root
-- (scope class org, chain=id), so they carry the chain conjunct like any other
-- tenant statement and the binding layer takes `id` from the proof. That is
-- what makes an org nobody may reach indistinguishable from a missing one
-- (#48, mvp-boundary C1).
