-- Audit trails (#45): the application layer holds INSERT and SELECT only on
-- both audit tables - the append-only CI invariant scans this file. Chain
-- parameters are bound by the store's binding layer (and, for the denial
-- writer, by the authorization package's enumerated surface) from resolved
-- chains only - never from caller arguments.
--
-- Interactive and export page order is seq (allocation equals commit order on
-- sqlite). Export queries use the same seq column for their selection floor
-- and internal page cursor. Timestamps are fixed-width UTC microsecond text,
-- so recorded_at range predicates compare correctly.
