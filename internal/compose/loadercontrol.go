// The loader-control baseline has a SINGLE home in internal/delivery
// (loadercontrol.go), shared by both delivery paths — #63 (Compose) here and
// #64 (the Kubernetes operator). This file keeps the compose-facing spellings
// (IsLoaderControl / RefuseUnacknowledged) but backs them by that one table so
// the ADR's "may extend, never silently shrink" invariant is pinned in exactly
// one place.

// IsLoaderControl reports whether name is a loader-control variable. Matching is
// CASE-SENSITIVE: environment variable names are case-sensitive on Linux, so
// `path` is not `PATH`. It re-exports delivery.IsLoaderControlKey.
