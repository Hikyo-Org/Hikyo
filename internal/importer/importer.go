// Package importer is the client-side import framework (#68, import-paths ADR
// as amended by the flat-model ADR).
//
// Connectors read foreign bytes from bounded export files or read-only live
// provider APIs and return records; the framework enforces uniform bounds,
// applies the canonical key grammar, and authors the four phase-1 artifacts.
// It never contacts the Hikyo server — the CLI does that, with the
// server-minted material this package records.
//
// Two invariants govern every line here:
//
//   - CONNECTORS ARE STRICTLY READ-ONLY. The interface exposes no write
//     operation to implement, which is what makes "a migration tool cannot
//     destroy the thing being migrated from" structural rather than a
//     per-connector courtesy.
//   - EVERY FOREIGN BYTE IS SECRET FROM FIRST READ UNTIL CLASSIFIED. No error
//     built in this package carries source content. Errors name keys, paths,
//     bounds and codes — never a YAML snippet, never a value fragment, never a
//     decoder's echo of what it choked on. That is why no parser error is ever
//     wrapped: yaml.v3 renders a type mismatch as "cannot unmarshal !!str
//     sk_live... into map[string]string", which puts a value prefix on stderr.
//     Structural facts (a document index, a bound, a key name) are the whole
//     vocabulary.
