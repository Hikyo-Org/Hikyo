// Grant-lock analyzer (#54 B14). credential-reset's org-bounded test is made
// serializable by locking the target's `principals` row: the reset reads the
// target's grant set under that lock, so a concurrent grant landing must take the
// same lock and therefore serialize behind (or ahead of) the reset. That
// guarantee holds only if EVERY grant writer takes the lock. The general grant
// surface is #55's; this analyzer pins the obligation now so a future grant
// writer cannot forget it — a grant writer that skips the lock is a build
// failure, not a review miss.
//
// The check is structural, like the sole-writer analyzer it is modelled on: any
// function — in ANY module package, not just the resolution surface — that names
// a grant-table-mutating generated query must also take the principal-row lock in
// the same body, and the lock must type-resolve to the REAL LockPrincipalRow (the
// generated query or the authn resolver wrapper that calls it), not merely any
// selector spelled that way. Residual, stated so it is not mistaken for more:
// the analyzer cannot prove the lock is taken on the RIGHT principal row, nor
// that it precedes the write in execution order within the same transaction —
// that is review's job. Where it cannot be sure it errs toward flagging
// (fail-closed): a grant writer with no resolvable lock at all is a build
// failure, never a silent pass.

// grantTables are the tables whose writers must hold the principal-row lock.
// `grant_origins` joins `grants` (#55): releasing the last origin deletes the
// grant row, so an origin write is a grant write with one more step, and the
// same serialization obligation binds it.
// The member access rule tables join them (member-access-rules ADR): a rule is
// standing authority read by authorize(), so its writers serialize the same way.
