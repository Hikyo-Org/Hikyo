// Embedded single-page-application serving (#56).
//
// `embed.FS` has no SPA semantics of its own, so the system-architecture ADR
// § Frontend specifies them and this file is where they live:
//
//   - reserved prefixes (the contract, the probes, the metrics surface and the
//     hashed-asset directory) NEVER fall back to the document;
//   - fallback applies only to a GET/HEAD that asks for HTML, so a mistyped
//     fetch() fails at its status code rather than at JSON.parse;
//   - a missing hashed asset is a build error, so it 404s;
//   - hashed assets are immutable, `index.html` is never cached.
//
// The asset tree arrives as an `fs.FS` rather than being embedded here. That
// keeps the rules testable against a synthetic tree — and keeps `go build` and
// `go test` green for someone who has never run the frontend build, because
// the embed itself sits behind the `ui` tag in internal/webui.

// assetPrefix is the hashed-asset directory. It is reserved: Vite writes every
// content-hashed file under it, so a 404 there is always a build error.
const assetPrefix = "/assets/"

// indexPath is the document served for every application route.
const indexPath = "index.html"

// contentSecurityPolicy is the v1 baseline the ADR fixes. Self-only by
// default, no inline script or style (which constrains the frontend build,
// deliberately), no framing, no plugin content, no base-tag rewriting.
// Tuning belongs to the ops spec; the baseline's existence does not.

// crossOriginOpenerPolicy isolates this instance's browsing-context group from
// the windows it opens, with the ONE exception the shell actually needs.
//
// `same-origin-allow-popups`, not `same-origin`, and the difference is a
// working product (#517). The shell runs two ceremonies through popups that
// navigate CROSS-ORIGIN and then close themselves: the identity provider's
// authorization window returning to /oidc/done, and the workspace handoff's
// authorization window on the REMOTE instance returning to this origin's
// callback page. Under `same-origin` the browser severs those popups into a
// fresh browsing-context group, and a popup that is no longer script-closable
// stays open forever on a page that says "you can close this window".
//
// The isolation that matters is kept either way: this document cannot be
// reached through `window.opener` by anything cross-origin, and the return
// path never used `opener` in the first place. The popups are opened with
// `noopener` and hand back over a same-origin `BroadcastChannel`.

// gate (that is workspaceCORS's job, and it stays a closed allowlist).

// permissionsPolicy denies the powerful features this application never uses.
// Deliberately SHORT: every named feature is one an operator would have to
// audit, and a long list of denials for features the browser does not grant
// without a prompt anyway buys nothing.
//
// WebAuthn is NOT named, and that is load-bearing: `publickey-credentials-get`
// and `publickey-credentials-create` default to `self`, which is precisely
// what the passkey ceremonies need, and naming them at all risks writing an
// allowlist that a future edit narrows to `()`.

//
// The workspace tier is the BROWSER talking to a remote directly, so the shell
// must be permitted to reach those origins — and only those. It stays a CLOSED
// LIST, never `*`: an origin that is not a configured remote is not reachable
// from this instance's UI, which is the whole point of naming them.
//
// `frame-ancestors 'none'` is untouched and stays everywhere: the popup is a

// important one — `https://*.example.test` contains no forbidden character and
// broadens connect-src to every matching subdomain, in a directive whose whole
