// Package authz is the authorization chokepoint (permission +
// tenant-isolation ADRs): authorize(principal, capability-formula, scope)
// evaluated in-transaction against current policy with no cache, returning a
// proof-carrying value the store accepts calls only with. This package, the
// resolution surface (internal/store/authn), the transaction package, and
// the store's query registry form the enumerated trusted set — changes here
// are the highest-scrutiny diffs in the repo.

// Proof is evidence that authorize() ran, for one operation, inside one
// still-live transaction. It is an interface with an unexported method,
// implemented by exactly one unexported type in this package: outside code
// cannot implement it and cannot construct a non-nil value of it — the only
// forgeable value is nil, and the store boundary rejects that fail-closed
// (tenant-isolation ADR § chokepoint pattern). A proof is not a capability
// token: it dies with its transaction, so it cannot be stored, replayed, or
// reused across retries.
