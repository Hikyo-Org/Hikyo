// Federated machine identities at the chokepoint (#62, machine-identities ADR §
// Federation, § Authentication, authorization and the fetch path).
//
// A federated principal resolves HERE, at the same chokepoint, in the same
// transaction, uncached, exactly like its bearer-token sibling — the ADR's
// propagation to the architecture ticket does not distinguish the kinds. What it
// gets is the same Identity, so its authority is the union of the grants on the
// service account and nothing else. There is no per-credential scope on either
// kind, so there is nothing for federation to widen.
//
// What is deliberately NOT here: the cryptographic validation and the pinned
// -claim policy. Both need the network (a JWKS fetch) or a JSON claim
// vocabulary, and neither belongs inside a database transaction — a hung issuer
// must never become a held write lock. The service validates the token BEFORE it
// opens the transaction and passes the resulting predicate in; this function
// owns the row read, the binding predicate's INVOCATION, and the liveness rules.

// Re-exported so the service layer never names the resolution-surface package.

// BindingPredicate is the binding-specific half of federated validation:
// audience, every pinned claim, the CI event rule and the post-restore `iat`
// predicate, evaluated against the rows that were actually resolved.
//
// It arrives as a function rather than as data because its inputs are the
// presented token's claims, which the caller already holds, and its
// implementation is in internal/oidcfed — a package the chokepoint deliberately
// does not import. Passing the check in keeps the protocol library behind its own
// wall while still making the check unskippable: AuthenticateFederated REFUSES a
// nil predicate rather than treating it as "no further conditions".
//
// It receives the ISSUER ROW READ IN THIS TRANSACTION, not the one the caller
// captured before validation, and that argument is the fix for a real
// time-of-check gap: the network half of federated authentication runs outside
// any transaction, so an administrator who adds a refused audience or switches
// the key source while a slow verification is in flight would otherwise have that
// request complete under the superseded policy. The predicate compares the two
// and refuses when they disagree.

// AuthenticateFederated resolves a validated federated identity to its service
// account.
//
// The reads are FIXED in number and order, like the bearer path's, and every
// predicate is evaluated after all of them. Returning as soon as one failed
// would make an unbound identity cost one query and a revoked binding two — a
// query-count oracle for which bindings exist. The resolution-surface read
// performs the same row decode on a miss as on a hit (federation.go's decoy
// block), so the work above the storage engine is equal too.
//
// Two residuals, stated rather than discovered.
//
// An UNKNOWN ISSUER short-circuits earlier than an unbound subject, because the
// caller cannot look up a binding without an issuer id and cannot verify a
// signature without keys. What that discloses is which issuers the instance
// trusts — instance configuration an operator publishes to the platforms it
// federates with anyway, not which workloads exist, which is the fact the
// uniformity rule protects.
//
// The binding predicate's own COST varies with how far it gets: a token failing
// the audience check does less work than one failing the last pinned claim, and
// the miss path's decoy pins are three claims that will not match rather than
// this binding's. Equalising that would mean comparing every pin of every
// binding whatever the outcome, which is a different and larger machine than the
// one the ADR asks for; the request is uniformity "as far as practical, with
// residuals documented", and this is one. The response shape is identical in
// every case, which is the half that is not a residual.
