	// The formulas, and why each is what it is:
	//
	//   - read      → `read(E)`. The permission-model ADR's `read` carries "the
	//                 project key catalogue … validation status, diffs
	//                 (write-presence only for `secret` keys); **`config`
	//                 values**". Presence is write-presence; `config`
	//                 plaintext rides `read` because classification IS the
	//                 sensitivity boundary.
	//   - reveal    → `read(E) ∧ reveal(E)`, the locked disclosure row for
	//                 current `secret` material, with one audit event per
	//                 disclosed key.
	//   - write     → `edit(E) ∧ publish(E)`. `edit` alone is the ADR's
	//                 working-state atom and "creates no revision"; this slice
	//                 has no working state, so a write here IS delivered
	//                 material the moment it commits. Requiring `publish` as
	//                 well is the fail-closed reading of the same table that
	//                 puts `publish(destination)` on every operation that
	//                 makes an environment start delivering something. When
	//                 #51 lands drafts, the draft write is `edit` alone and

	//   - copy      → the locked row, split across the two scopes it names,
	//                 because a formula is evaluated against ONE addressed
	//                 scope and this one spans two: `reveal(source E)` on the
	//                 source and `reveal(destination E) ∧ publish(destination
	//                 E)` on each destination. Clone-at-creation and

	//                 ergonomic operations differ in what they copy, never in
	//                 what authorizes it.
	//

	// secrets land absent, enumerated by name" — and mvp-boundary C2's "a clone
	// that would leave a `mode: all` required secret absent aborts naming the
