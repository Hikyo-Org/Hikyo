// An authorization denial from an authenticated principal is an operation
// outcome, and its event is durable before the error response is sent — no
// async fire-and-forget path exists for it (audit-model ADR § Denials).
//
// The mechanics honour "re-authorize before every sensitive step": a denial
// can follow real writes inside the same closure, and those writes must roll
// back while the denial event must not. authorize()'s fail path therefore
// CAPTURES the denial here, bound to the attempt's authorizer; the
// transaction package rolls the attempt back and then flushes every captured
// denial through the enumerated resolution surface (authn.WriteDenial — the
// interface's first pinned write path, amendment part 4) in its own small
// transaction, before the error returns to the caller. A flush failure is a
// loud error, never the uniform denial: a denial response without its
// durable record is exactly what fail-closed forbids.

// Denial is one captured denial event awaiting its durable flush. The actor
// class is resolved (principals.kind) inside the flush transaction, so the
// probe-visible attempt keeps its fixed query count. Scope is the chain
// authorize() itself resolved (tenant trail) or empty (instance trail) —
// carried beside the event because the envelope deliberately has no chain
// field a caller could populate.

// addresses, so a refusal's envelope carries what it was about.
//
// It exists for the schema model's per-key audit obligation on the reveal
// gates ("every attempt is audited ... per key and per principal"): the
// grant.denied PAYLOAD is a closed schema shared by every operation and must
// not grow a key field, but the envelope's object type/id is exactly the place
// an acted-on object belongs, and it already round-trips to both audit tables.
//
// It attributes, it never authorizes: the object id is caller-supplied
// vocabulary that decides nothing, and the formula is evaluated as before.

// It exists for the schema model's "every attempt is audited" obligation on the
// reveal gates. A gate attempt has to be recorded whether it was allowed,
// denied or rate-limited — and the denied and limited cases roll their
// transaction back, so an in-transaction insert would vanish exactly when it
// matters. This is the one path in the system that survives a rollback, and
// widening its use is a deliberate, reviewed act rather than a convenience:
// callers must carry no instance data in the payload, because these rows are
// written outside the operation's own authorization scope.
