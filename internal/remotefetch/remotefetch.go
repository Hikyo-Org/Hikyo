// Package remotefetch is the directory tier's outbound client (#71,
// multi-instance ADR § The outbound client).
//
// It is a NEW OUTBOUND SURFACE ON THE SERVER, and the threat model's amendment
// enumerates it as one class — configured remote hikyo instances — under the
// full user-configured-outbound control set. Every exported knob below is one
// of that set's normative members, and the package exists as its own package
// so the set is enforced in one place rather than re-derived per caller.
//
// The property that makes the air-gap statement survive this feature: an
// instance with zero configured remotes performs ZERO outbound connections.
// Nothing here runs on a timer — there is deliberately no background poller
// (the system-architecture ADR fixed no generic job framework, and a standing
// authenticated heartbeat toward every remote for a health dot nobody is
// looking at is exactly what that rules out). A fetch happens because a holder
// of `instance-directory` is looking at the directory, and at no other moment.
