# Handoff: #75 key rotation operations (five ops, crash-safe root rotation)

Issue: https://github.com/Hikyo-Org/Hikyo/issues/75 (parent #41; blocked-by #43
and #51, both merged). Spec: `docs/adr/encryption-model.md` § Rotation and
§ CI-enforced invariants (7, 8, 9, 15). Milestone v1.0.

Branch: `worktree-implement-75`. Model label `model:fable-5`; **implemented by
Claude Opus 4.8** (the running model), a deviation from the label flagged to the
human. Review routing per the label: Codex `gpt-5.6-sol` high.

## Status: 4 of 5 operations complete, reencrypt + writer-fence + E2E remain

`rotate-token-key` shipped with #51. This ticket adds the other four. The
inventory (ADR § Rotation names five; the scanning key's `rotate-scanning-key`
is #39, explicitly out of scope):

| Operation | State |
|---|---|
| multi-version DEK resolution (prerequisite) | **done**, committed |
| `rotate-dek --project/--instance` | **done**, committed |
| `rotate-master-key` | **done**, committed |
| `rotate-root-key --prepare/--verify/--finalize` | **done**, committed |
| writer fence (invariant 7 writer clause) | **infra built + value-stage wired**; remaining paths below |
| `reencrypt --project` (folds in **#187**) | **COMPLETE + pg-validated** — 5 tables + retire, `TestReencryptProjectMovesValueToActiveVersion`, BOTH engines |
| `reencrypt --instance` | **COMPLETE + pg-validated** — all 6 credential tables + retire, `TestReencryptInstanceMovesCredentials`, BOTH engines (row_version CAS + blob-CAS) |
| reencrypt HTTP/CLI transport + scheduler pacing | **not built** — the service methods `ReencryptProject`/`ReencryptInstance` are the seam; wire a CLI `reencrypt --project\|--instance` + routes (project=tenant-class under `/orgs/{org}/projects/{project}/reencrypt`, instance=instance-class under `/instance/reencrypt`), and a `ScheduledJob` sweeping scopes with a `retiring` version |
| kill -9 mid-root-rotation E2E | crypto-level crash-safety **done**; live-op E2E pending |

### CI invariants (ADR § CI-enforced)

Green now: 8 (crash-safe root rotation — `TestRootKeyRotationCrashSafe`), 9
(master rotation completeness + dual-wrap refusal — `TestMasterKeyRotation*`),
and the "no snapshot moves" half of 15 (already green from #51's
`rotate-token-key`). Invariant 7 (rotation completeness / writer race) and the
reencrypt half of everything are **pending with reencrypt**.

## What exists (committed on this branch)

Four commits, each green (build, vet, gofmt, `go test` on sqlite; isolation
invariants; api/cli goldens; TS client regenerated + typechecked):

1. **`feat(crypto): multi-version tier-3 key resolution`** — a scope's DEK is a
   `versionSet` (active + retiring), not a single handle. Writes seal under the
   active version; reads resolve the version named in the record header
   (`ProjectSealer.openVersioned`, `InstanceSealer.OpenField`), so a sealer
   opens ciphertext a reencrypt has not yet moved. Store `GetTier3Versions`;
   authz `keys.Tier3Versions`; `crypto.RecordKeyVersion` exposes a record's
   header version for reencrypt.
2. **`feat(crypto): rotate-dek`** — append a DEK version, demote the old active
   to `retiring`. `Prepare{Project,Instance}DEKRotation` mirror the token
   pattern; store `RotateDEK` under the hierarchy + scope fences, demote-CAS +
   stale-master guard. HTTP `POST /api/v1/instance/rotate-dek`; CLI
   `rotate-dek --instance|--project`; audit `crypto.dek_rotated`.
3. **`feat(crypto): rotate-master-key`** — master is now a version-indexed set
   (`masterSet`, atomic), so tier-3 unwrap resolves its master by the row's
   version (this retired #43's "scaffolding honesty" refusal in `unwrapTier3`
   and closed the commit→adopt window). `PrepareMasterKeyRotation` re-wraps
   every openable tier-3 under a new master; **DEK caches are NOT evicted** (key
   bytes unchanged). Store `RotateMasterKey` refuses when active master count
   != 1 (dual-wrapped), CAS-retires the old master, updates every tier-3
   wrapping. New queries `AllOpenableTier3`, `UpdateTier3Wrapping`,
   `RetireMasterAtVersion`.
4. **`feat(crypto): rotate-root-key`** — crash-safe dual-wrapped protocol.
   `PrepareRootKeyRotation` seals the in-memory master under the new root at
   epoch+1 (no current root needed); `VerifyRootKeyRotation` confirms the
   primary source now unwraps the new wrapper; boot warns on the dual-wrapped
   state (`RootRotationPending`). New root read from `HIKYO_NEW_ROOT_KEY_FILE`
   — **no key material on the API**. Store `RootKeyRotatePrepare` /
   `RootKeyRotateFinalize`; query `RetireMasterWrapperAtEpoch`. Three audit
   events. **Also fixed a latent sqlc-sqlite mis-slice**: an em-dash in a query
   comment truncated the generated `AcquireScopeGeneration` statement at
   runtime (not codegen) — see the `sqlc-sqlite-non-ascii-truncation` note.

### Key design facts for a continuer

- **All keyring KeyStore reads run under `SiteBoot` SystemProof** (via
  `internal/store/keyring`), including on-demand DEK loads. The four rotation
  **writes** run under the operator proof through the service's own `tx.Write`
  (like `RotateTokenKey`), NOT the boot path.
- **`rotate-master-key` and `rotate-root-key` are mutually exclusive**, enforced
  by the "exactly one active master wrapper" check inside the hierarchy fence.
- **`RootKeySource`** (`internal/service`) re-reads root material on demand
  (master/root rotation); the app impl (`rootKeySource` in `internal/app/app.go`)
  reads the same file/env sources boot used. The isolation harness uses
  `probeRootSource` / `mutableRootSource` (`harness_test.go`).
- Crash-safety is testable **in-process**: a crash mid-rotation leaves the same
  persisted state as a clean stop, and `LoadKeyring` IS the reboot. No
  real-binary process harness is needed (none exists in `internal/isolation`).

## Remainder — precise design (worked out, not yet built)

### Writer fence — INFRASTRUCTURE BUILT, wiring in progress

`feat(crypto): writer fence infrastructure + value-stage wiring` shipped the
complete fence mechanism: store query `AssertActiveTier3Version` (sqlite plain /
postgres `FOR SHARE`), `KeyReader.AssertActiveDEKVersion`, `store.ErrStaleDEK`,
authz op `keys.AssertActiveDEKVersion`, and the `fenceProject` / `fenceInstance`
service helpers (map `ErrStaleDEK` → conflict). Wired into the **value-stage**
path so far. **Remaining: add `StoreKeysAssertActiveDEKVersion` to each other
ciphertext-writing operation's store set, and call the helper before its store
write.** The paths and their operations:

- `OpValuePublish` (value_entries + snapshot_entries), `OpValueSet` (declare),
  `OpRevisionRestore` (rollback re-seal) — `fenceProject`.
- the adapter ops (`OpAdapterConfigure`/`CredentialSet`/`Adopt`/`Move`) —
  `fenceProject`.
- password / totp / recovery / oidc-provider / saml-sp-key / remote-credential
  ops — `fenceInstance`.

Add a **completeness gate** (a test in the `hikyo:table` lint idiom) asserting
every encrypted column's write path calls a fence helper, so a future write
can't silently skip it. The original design below stands.



Every ciphertext write must not commit under a version being retired. The hole
(confirmed): a sealer built at active=N, then rotate-dek + full reencrypt +
retire all complete, then the writer's tx opens — a plain state read finds no
conflict and the writer seals under retired N. Close it with a **locking read**:

- New query `LockTier3VersionShared`: sqlite `SELECT state FROM tier3_keys WHERE
  purpose=? AND org_id=? AND project_id=? AND version=?`; postgres the same with
  `FOR SHARE`. One query is both the lock and the check.
- New store method `AssertActiveDEKVersion(pf, purpose, org, proj, version)` →
  require `state='active'`, else `ErrStaleDEK` (new, beside `ErrRotationSuperseded`).
- The version is already in the ciphertext — call `crypto.RecordKeyVersion(blob)`
  in the store write method rather than threading a new param (store already
  imports crypto). Scope (purpose/org/proj) is on the row being written.
- Wire into all **11** ciphertext-writing store paths (see table below). In-flight
  writers hold `FOR SHARE` on row N, so rotate-dek's demote and reencrypt's
  retire of N block until they commit; a writer starting after demote sees
  `retiring` → `ErrStaleDEK`. Map `ErrStaleDEK` → `domain.ErrConflict` (409); the
  client retries the request (getting a fresh sealer). Rejection satisfies the
  invariant — no in-service re-seal loop is required.
- sqlite needs no `FOR SHARE` (single write connection serializes globally); the
  plain `SELECT` + state check is enough there.

**It lands whole or not at all** — a fence covering 5 of 11 tables that claims
invariant 7 is worse than no fence commit.

### reencrypt --project X / --instance  (folds in #187)

**#187 sharpens this with the ops-spec §9 bounds** — the reencrypt walk is
**background, chunked 100 rows, 100 ms inter-chunk pause, resumable, per-row
compare-and-swap, with a row-count preflight + progress.** Acceptance also flips
a bound-registry entry from `enforcement-pending` to `enforced` — but that
registry (`#77`'s `feat(ops): bound registry`, commit `ad99ec4d`) is on the
parallel branch `t3code/implement-ticket-work-2`, **not on main or this branch**,
so the flip is a cross-branch coordination item, not part of this feature's code.
Build the walk here; flip the registry when #77 lands (or in the merge that
unifies them).

**Per-row CAS (anti-resurrection) strategy — verified against the schema:**
- Project tables (value_entries, snapshot_entries, pending_changes, adapters,
  adapter_route_moves) have **no row-version column**; CAS on the **old
  ciphertext blob** (`UPDATE … SET ciphertext=? WHERE id=? AND ciphertext=?`).
  A concurrent fresh write changed the blob → CAS matches 0 rows → skip (that
  row is already on the active version). value_entries is normally
  delete-then-insert-with-fresh-id (the id is AAD-bound), but reencrypt keeps
  the **same id and AAD** (only the DEK version moves), so an in-place ciphertext
  UPDATE is correct and exempt from that convention; the append-only lint guards
  only the two audit tables, so it does not block this.
- Instance tables (password/totp/recovery/oidc/saml) have `dek_version` +
  `row_version`; CAS on **row_version** (the existing guard #187 refers to),
  and stamp the new `dek_version = InstanceSealer.Version()`.
- remotes has neither; blob-CAS like the project tables.

**Adapters + adapter_route_moves specifics (the last two project tables):** these
use the **raw-SQL adapter repo** (`repos_adapters.go`, `sqliteAdapters{db}`), NOT
sqlc — so add hand-written list/CAS queries in that pattern, not `.sql` files.
AAD for BOTH is `ProjectFieldAAD{OwnerTable:"adapters", OwnerRowID:<adapter_id>,
FieldTag:"credential"}` (no env/key/snapshot). Note `adapter_route_moves` is
**keyed by its own move id but its AAD OwnerRowID is the adapter_id** — so
`projectFieldRow` needs a distinct `owner` field (add it; value/snapshot/pending
leave it as id). Both ciphertext columns are **nullable** (adapter without a set
credential; move without a pending credential) — the walker already skips empty
ciphertext. Then wire two authz store ops each into `OpReencryptProject`.

**The retire (once all 5 project tables walk):** after a full pass moves zero
rows, every retiring version is unreferenced (the walk moved everything to active
and the writer fence blocks new retiring-version writes). Retire them inside the
scope fence (`AcquireScopeGeneration` FOR UPDATE) with a new
`RetireRetiringTier3ForScope` query (`state='retiring'→'retired'` for the scope),
then `evictProjectDEK` + zero. Loop-until-a-pass-moves-zero for crash-resume.

**The proven pattern (value_entries, `internal/service/reencrypt.go`) — replicate
per table:** (1) a `ListXForReencrypt` keyset-paged query + a `ReencryptX` CAS
update query (both engines, with the scope-class chain conjuncts the predicate
analyzer requires); (2) `ReencryptRow`-shaped store methods + two authz store
ops added to `OpReencryptProject`'s set; (3) a `reencryptXChunk` walk function
mirroring `reencryptValueChunk` — reconstruct the AAD with that table's existing
builder, `RecordKeyVersion` to skip active rows, `OpenX`→`SealX`, CAS-update.
Per-table specifics: snapshot_entries (`snapshotAAD`, has snapshot_id; immutable
so CAS always matches), pending_changes (`pendingAAD`, ciphertext NULL for
`unset` → skip those rows), adapters + adapter_route_moves (owner_table
`adapters`, `SealField`/`OpenField`). Instance tables use `InstanceSealer`,
stamp the new `dek_version`, and CAS on `row_version`.

A resumable, per-row-transactional walker that moves every ciphertext onto the
scope's active DEK version, then retires the superseded versions.

**The complete encrypted-column surface (11 columns), from the inventory:**

Project-scoped (project DEK) — `reencrypt --project` walks these 5:

| table.column | kind | version col? | AAD (owner_table / field_tag / extras) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `value_entries.ciphertext` | value | none (header-parse) | env_id,key_id,row=id,field=`value` |
| `pending_changes.ciphertext` | project_field | none | `pending_changes` / `pending_value` / +env_id,+key_id |
| `snapshot_entries.ciphertext` | project_field | none | `snapshot_entries` / `snapshot_value` / +env_id,+key_id,+snapshot_id |
| `adapters.credential_ciphertext` | project_field | none | `adapters` / `credential` (no trailing triple) |
| `adapter_route_moves.pending_credential_ciphertext` | project_field | none | `adapters` / `credential` (owner_row_id = adapter_id) |

Instance-scoped (instance DEK) — `reencrypt --instance` walks these 6:

| table.column | version col | AAD (owner_table / owner_row / field_tag) |
|---|---|---|
| `password_credentials.verifier` | `dek_version` (+`row_version` CAS) | `password_credentials` / account_id / `verifier` |
| `totp_credentials.seed` | `dek_version` | `totp_credentials` / row id / `seed` |
| `recovery_codes.batch` | `dek_version` | `recovery_codes` / account_id / `batch` |
| `oidc_providers.client_secret` | `dek_version` | `oidc_providers` / provider_id / `client_secret` |
| `saml_sp_keys.encrypted_private_key` | `dek_version` | `saml_sp_keys` / key id / `private_key` |
| `remotes.credential_sealed` | none (header-parse) | `remotes` / remote_id / `credential` |

**AAD reconstruction — REUSE the existing builders, do not re-derive** (a wrong
field is a permanent decrypt failure). The walker must rebuild each row's AAD
with the exact same function that sealed it:
- value_entries → `valueAAD(store.ValueEntry{...})` (values.go): org, project,
  env, key, row=id, field `value`.
- snapshot_entries → `snapshotAAD(org, project, env, key, snapshotID, rowID)`
  (publish.go): owner_table `snapshot_entries`, field `snapshot_value`.
- pending_changes → `pendingAAD(org, project, env, key, rowID)` (publish.go):
  owner_table `pending_changes`, field `pending_value` (no snapshot_id).
- adapters / adapter_route_moves → the adapter AAD builder (owner_table
  `adapters`, owner_row `adapter_id`, field `credential`, no trailing triple).
- instance tables → `InstanceFieldAAD{owner_table, owner_row, field_tag}` per the
  inventory row.
The list query for each table must therefore SELECT every column those builders
read. Re-seal is `pt := sealer.OpenX(aad, oldCt); newCt := sealer.SealX(aad, pt)`
— Open resolves the header's (retiring) version, Seal uses the active one.

**`reencrypt --instance` — fully de-risked spec (build as `OpReencryptInstance`,
ClassInstance, empty scope, `CapReencrypt@None`; the 6 credential tables are
class=instance, no tenant chain).** Use the `InstanceSealer` (OpenField/SealField,
`InstanceFieldAAD{OwnerTable, OwnerRowID, FieldTag}`). Confirmed per-table:

| table | pk | ciphertext col | AAD owner_row | field_tag | CAS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| password_credentials | account_id | verifier | account_id | verifier | row_version + stamp dek_version |
| totp_credentials | id | seed | id | seed | row_version + dek_version |
| recovery_codes | account_id | batch | account_id | batch | row_version + dek_version |
| oidc_providers | id | client_secret | id | client_secret | row_version + dek_version |
| saml_sp_keys | id | encrypted_private_key | id | private_key | row_version + dek_version |
| remotes | id | credential_sealed | id | credential | **blob-CAS** (no dek_version/row_version) |

Write an instance walk mirroring `walkTable` but with the `InstanceSealer`, a CAS
of `WHERE …=? AND row_version=?` that sets `row_version=row_version+1` and stamps
`dek_version = InstanceSealer.Version()` (5 tables), and blob-CAS for remotes.
Because the 5 tables carry `dek_version`, the list can `WHERE dek_version <> ?`
(active) to skip current rows in SQL rather than header-parsing. Then the retire
reuses `RetireRetiringTier3(PurposeInstance, "", "")` and
`InstanceSealer`-side eviction (add an `EvictInstanceDEK` / reload of the atomic
instance set). password/totp/recovery/oidc use sqlc query files; saml + remotes
— check whether they are sqlc or raw and follow suit.

**Walker design (per the advisor):**

- A per-table registry entry: `{table, ciphertext column, optional version
  column, scope columns, AAD reconstruction fn}`. Each entry needs a **list**
  query (id + ciphertext + AAD component columns, scoped) and an **update**
  query (set ciphertext, and `dek_version` where present, by id + optimistic
  `row_version` where present). That is ~22 query pairs × 2 engines — the bulk
  of the mechanical work. Keep them sqlc (the repo forbids raw SQL in the store
  layer); do NOT introduce a dynamic-table-name walker.
- Per row: `crypto.RecordKeyVersion(blob)`; if == active, skip (this is what
  makes it resumable — re-run skips current rows). Else open under the old
  version via the scope sealer (which holds the retiring versions), re-seal
  under active, UPDATE in its **own transaction**. No global lock.
- Loop passes until a full pass moves zero rows — that "dry" pass IS the
  zero-reference proof. Then, inside the scope fence (`AcquireScopeGeneration`
  FOR UPDATE, which the writer fence's FOR SHARE blocks against), retire every
  `retiring` version whose ciphertext is gone (`RetireRetiringTier3AtVersion`,
  a new CAS query `state='retiring'→'retired'`).
- **DEK-cache eviction lands here**: the `cacheDEK` comment already notes
  rotation's fence is the one place eviction+zeroing is legal. `evictProjectDEK`
  exists; add the instance equivalent and zero the retired version's buffer.
- Expose two ways (satisfies #187's "background job", the issue's "scheduler
  job" wording, and the ADR's "resumable from the CLI"): a `ScheduledJob`
  (`internal/app/scheduler.go`, `ScheduledJob{Name, Run, LastSuccess}`) that
  sweeps for any scope with a `retiring` version and processes it **in 100-row
  chunks with a 100 ms inter-chunk pause** (#187), resuming across runs — the
  crash-resume, for free — **plus** an HTTP/CLI `reencrypt --project/--instance`
  that preflights the row count, triggers/awaits the walk, and reports progress
  (`rows_moved` / remaining). Share the chunk-walk core between the two.
- **Completeness gate**: add an analyzer/test in the `hikyo:table` lint idiom
  asserting every encrypted column is declared in the reencrypt registry, so a
  future encrypted column cannot silently escape reencrypt.
- Audit `crypto.reencrypt_completed` (already designed: scope, org, project,
  rows_moved) — register it WITH its emitter, per the "stage beside the emitter"
  discipline (registering an event with no emitter reddens
  `every_registered_type_is_actually_emitted`).
- authz: op `crypto.reencrypt` (formula `reencrypt@instance`), store ops
  `keys.RetireRetiringTier3` + the per-table read/write ops. HTTP `POST
  /api/v1/instance/reencrypt` {scope, org?, project?}; CLI `reencrypt
  --instance|--project`. `usr_root` already holds the `reencrypt` grant.

### Live-op E2E (acceptance K1)

An isolation E2E running the full recovery order on live data —
`rotate-root-key` (prepare→install→verify→finalize) → `rotate-master-key` →
`rotate-dek` (project + instance) → `reencrypt` (project + instance) →
`rotate-token-key` — asserting values stay readable throughout and, after
reencrypt, zero ciphertext references a retired version. The kill -9 clause is
covered by `TestRootKeyRotationCrashSafe` in-process (a crash leaves the same
persisted dual-wrapped state; `LoadKeyring` is the reboot). Run on both engines
(`HIKYO_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`).

## Review record

Three-axis review of the 4 delivered ops (Standards + Spec Claude sub-agents +
cross-model Codex `gpt-5.6-sol` high, per the standing routing). **Codex and the
Claude Spec reviewer independently converged on the same three concurrency bugs**
— all fixed in `fix(crypto): rotation review round 1`:

- **CRITICAL** — master rotation's zero-reference check ran outside the fence; a
  tier-3 key created in the pre-fence window stranded under the retired master
  (instance-DEK variant bricked boot). Fixed: `CountOpenableTier3NotAtMaster`
  in-fence + predecessor-version pin.
- **HIGH** — root `--prepare` didn't pin the master version in-fence; a master
  rotation in the gap produced two active wrappers of different versions →
  brick. Fixed: version pin in `RootKeyRotatePrepare`.
- **MEDIUM** — `--finalize` didn't re-verify the primary root → skipping verify
  bricked boot. Fixed: finalize re-runs verify before retiring.

Plus: master adopt-window (new master made resolvable at prepare, activated on
commit, abort-zeroed on failure), constant-time verify compare, error→conflict
mappings, and the `rotate-root-key --yes` gate. Codex #4 (held sealer → retiring
DEK) is the deferred writer-fence unit (the ADR's "rotate-dek is incomplete on
its own").

**R2 (Codex, high):** closed R1 1/3/4; blocked on two — verify compared against
retained *retired* masters (not the active one), and two concurrent master
*preparations* mint different keys for one version so a version-keyed adopt could
activate/zero the wrong key. Both fixed: verify now requires the active version +
key; hierarchy rotations are serialized.

**R3 (Codex, high):** verify fix confirmed; the serialization lock was on each
`Rotation` instance rather than the shared object. Fixed by moving it to the
`Keyring` (the one object every service holds) — process-wide by construction.
Per the standing 3-round cap this lock-placement refinement (same R2 blocker, not
new scope) was fixed in-slice and verified by a scoped closure Codex pass rather
than routed to a ticket; the deviation is recorded here for the merge gate.

**Test gap the Spec reviewer flagged, to close with reencrypt:** the invariant-8/9
crypto tests use a single-threaded `memStore`, so the *fenced-interleaving*
clauses (a tier-3 created concurrently with master rotation; a master rotation
racing root prepare) are not exercised — only the serial happy paths. A
**store-level concurrent test on both engines** is required to exercise the new
in-fence refusals directly, and lands naturally with the writer-fence work.

## Deliberate deviations (for human disposition)

1. **Model label mismatch.** `model:fable-5`; implemented by Opus 4.8. The
   commit co-author reflects reality; the review routing (Codex high) is
   unaffected. Flagged rather than silently followed.
2. **Root-key rotation transport.** New root read from a server-side source
   (`HIKYO_NEW_ROOT_KEY_FILE`), never the API body — a request-supplied path
   would be a file-probe oracle. This is a command-surface decision the ADR
   delegates to #25; recorded here for that ticket.
3. **Crash-safety tested in-process**, not by killing a real binary — a crash
   and a clean stop leave identical persisted state, and `LoadKeyring` is the
   reboot. No real-binary process harness exists in `internal/isolation`.

## Verification record

`go build ./...` (incl. `-tags k8se2e`), `go vet`, `gofmt -l` clean.
`go test ./...` zero failures on sqlite (the `ui`-tagged webui embed needs a
built `dist`, a pre-existing local-only gap; CI builds the UI first). **Postgres
IS validated locally** (a dbugit dev pg 18 container at 127.0.0.1:5432): the
reencrypt cycle (both engines), the audit E2E's full rotation cycle
(rotate-token/dek/master/root + reencrypt) on pg, and the conformance / store /
isolation legs — all green. sqlc regeneration idempotent; oapi-codegen
regenerated; TS client regenerated + `tsc --noEmit` clean.

## Session continuation — reencrypt + fence completeness (this branch, latest)

Everything below is committed on `worktree-implement-75` and validated on BOTH
engines (sqlite + local pg 18: full crypto/service/store/isolation/conformance
legs green — last pg run 2287 passed).

**reencrypt COMPLETE for both scopes + transport.**
- `--project` (ClassTenant, needs the project chain): 5 tables —
  value_entries, snapshot_entries, pending_changes, adapters, adapter
  route-moves. `--instance` (ClassInstance, empty scope): 6 credential tables —
  password_credentials, totp_credentials, recovery_codes, oidc_providers,
  saml_sp_keys, remotes. `internal/store/repos_reencrypt.go` consolidates the 6
  instance tables; project tables via their own repos + raw-SQL adapters.
- Chunked (100 rows / 100ms pause, overridable), resumable (skips rows already
  at active), per-row CAS (blob-CAS for project value/remotes; row_version CAS +
  dek_version stamp for the versioned instance tables). AAD reconstructed per
  table from the existing builders. Retire is all-or-nothing per scope:
  `RetireRetiringTier3ForScope` runs inside the scope fence only once every
  table is dry, then EvictProjectDEK / ReloadInstanceDEK.
- Transport: `POST /api/v1/orgs/{org}/projects/{project}/reencrypt` and
  `POST /api/v1/instance/reencrypt`; `hikyo reencrypt --org O --project P` /
  `--instance`. Audited `crypto.reencrypt_completed`.

**Writer fence (invariant 7) — now COMPLETE across every sealing path.**
Previously only value-stage. Now every service function that seals ciphertext
for storage fences in its write tx before the store write:
- Project (fenceProject): value declare/set, copy dest (secret+config), import,
  publish (snapshot entries + cells), revision restore, all 4 adapter credential
  paths. Ops gained `StoreKeysAssertActiveDEKVersion`.
- Instance (fenceInstance / fenceInstanceVersion): remotes, OIDC, SAML SP-key.
- Authn-resolution surface (proof-free): password establish/upgrade, TOTP enrol,
  recovery generate/consume seal under the instance DEK with no tenant proof.
  New `authn.Resolver.AssertActiveInstanceDEKVersion` (same FOR SHARE assert,
  instance purpose) via `TxAuthorizer`. This closes the bare-INSERT window
  (WritePasswordCredential / WriteRecoveryCodes / CreateTOTP had no row_version
  CAS) where a slow argon2 derivation spanning a rotate-dek could strand an
  unreadable credential. KDF-upgrade-on-login skips (not fails) on a rotation
  race, preserving valid logins.

**InstanceSealer snapshot fix (correctness).** `Version()` used to re-read the
live active version, making the instance fence a no-op (compared live-to-live).
It now snapshots its write-handle at construction, mirroring ProjectSealer, so
Version() and the fence agree on the sealed version even across a concurrent
adoption. The old key buffer is GC-reclaimed (never zeroed on adoption), so a
captured handle stays usable — exactly the stale write the fence rejects.

**New CI gate.** `internal/lint/fence.go` (`CheckFenceCompleteness`) fails the
build if any `internal/service` function seals ciphertext without calling a
fence. Explicit `fence:delegated` (seal-helper returns version to a fencing
caller) and `fence:exempt` (never-written timing dummy) markers; reencrypt.go
(the mover) exempt wholesale. Negative fixture proves it fires.

**Live recovery-order E2E.** `TestFullRecoveryOrderOnLiveData` (both engines):
seeds a real value, runs rotate-root (prepare/verify/finalize) → rotate-master →
rotate-dek → reencrypt in sequence, asserts the value opens at every step, ends
on the active DEK version, and survives a fresh boot under the new root.

**kill-9 mid-root-rotation: VERIFIED covered** by the pre-existing
`TestRootKeyRotationCrashSafe` — seal under rootA → prepare (dual-wrapped) →
discard keyring and reboot from the datastore alone → RootRotationPending
surfaces and the value opens under BOTH old and new root → verify → finalize →
reboot clears pending and the old root is refused. LoadKeyring IS the reboot.

## Open: needs owner decision (A/B/C)

**ScheduledJob for background reencrypt (#187 pacing) — not built, needs a
decision.** The operator-triggered reencrypt (CLI/HTTP) is complete and
resumable. A scheduler that auto-sweeps scopes with a retiring version would
need SiteScheduler's system proof to gain write access to all 11 ciphertext
tables, materially widening the invariant-11 system-proof enumeration.
Options: (A) read-only sweep-and-warn under system proof — smallest surface,
reencrypt stays an operator act like the other rotations [recommended];
(B) full auto-reencrypt under system proof; (C) operator-only, document resume,
no scheduler. Not built pending the owner's pick.

## Review outcome

Reviewed by Codex (high) plus local Standards/Spec across two rounds; the
rotation core through db1d5cf1 passed its own closed R1-R3 earlier. R1 raised
one blocking data-loss finding — the retire ran an unconditional
`UPDATE tier3_keys SET state=retired WHERE state=retiring` with no zero-reference
check (ADR line 172: "verified by query inside the fence, never assumed"), which
a concurrent rotate-dek could turn into undecryptable moved rows — fixed before
merge (commit 122ceff8) with three in-fence layers (per-chunk re-assert, retire
re-assert under FOR SHARE, dryness scan over every table), the promised
reencrypt-coverage lint (`internal/lint/reencrypt_coverage.go`), and two TDD
refusal tests on both engines. R2 verified the fixes ("fixes sound") and the loop
CLOSED at R2 (cap 3, R3 not needed). Four items were dispositioned by the human
rather than code-changed, and the deliberate deviations they record still hold:
(1) the `CheckFenceCompleteness` lint proves seal/fence co-occurrence in a
function but not same-transaction — the 15 sealing sites were hand-verified in-tx
and the limit is stated in `fence.go`, accepted as a build-time-surfacing limit
because the runtime fence is the enforcement; (2) "per-row transactional" (ADR
line 149) is implemented chunk-transactional (100 rows per `tx.Write`) — a
deliberate deviation for connection-efficiency per #187's chunking mandate, with
per-row CAS resumability preserved; (3) the DEK version type split (uint32 in
crypto, int64 at the sqlc boundary) is unavoidable at the boundary; (4) the two
stale-DEK error conventions (`store.ErrStaleDEK` vs inline `domain.ErrConflict`)
are a package-layering constraint with the same surfaced behaviour.
