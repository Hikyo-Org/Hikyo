# Handoff: #55 permission model, full — grants, role templates, protected environments

Issue: https://github.com/Hikyo-Org/Hikyo/issues/55 (parent #41, blocked by #48 and
#54 — both merged). Governing spec: `docs/adr/permission-model.md` on
`wayfinder-docs` (locked 2026-07-31, plus the SCIM, flat-model and
multi-instance amendments), acceptance row A2 in `docs/adr/mvp-boundary.md`.

## What exists

### Vocabulary (`internal/domain`)

- **The closed capability atom set, in full** (`domain.go`): the six environment
  atoms, the four project atoms, `manage-members`, `manage-projects`, the seven
  instance operator atoms, plus the amendment atoms `scim-provision` (SCIM
  amendment (c)) and `instance-directory` (multi-instance amendment (a)), plus
  the two atoms earlier tickets added under their own ADR amendments
  (`audit-read` from #45, `credential-reset` from #54).
  `capabilityLevels` maps each atom to the DEEPEST scope it may be granted at —
  so `manage-projects` on one environment is refused rather than stored as a row
  nothing can evaluate. `Capabilities()`/`IsCapability()`/`DeepestLevel()` are
  the closed enumeration the grant API validates against.
- **The eight role templates** (`permission.go`), verbatim from the ADR table,
  with their applicable levels. `admin` carries `manage-projects` in a separate
  `orgOnly` list so the SAME template at project scope does not create it;
  `admin` seeds `reveal` and `reveal-history` as ordinary members of its
  capability list (they become independent rows); `operator` seeds neither.
  `ExpandTemplate(t, level)` is the only place a template name exists —
  expansion happens AT GRANT TIME and what lands is grants.
- **Machine principal classes and the NORMATIVE allowlists** (`permission.go`):
  `workload`, `automation`, `provisioning-connection`, `instance-connection`.
  `MachineMayHold` is consulted by the grant API as a refusal, not documented as
  a convention.
- **Origins**: the closed `OriginKind` enumeration (manual / break-glass / scim
  / structural / lockout-retention) with `IsMintableOrigin` gating what this
  ticket's writers may produce (manual + break-glass only).

### Schema (migration `00012_permission.sql`, both dialects)

- `grant_origins (id, grant_id, kind, subject, created_at)` with
  `UNIQUE(grant_id, kind, subject)` and a **RESTRICT** FK to `grants` — deleting
  a grant row while an origin still holds it is the ADR violation, so the
  database refuses it rather than tidying it away. `subject` is the origin's
  holder identity discriminated by `kind` (granting principal for `manual`, the
  literal `local-host-authority` for `break-glass`, the binding id for
  `scim`/`structural`). It is NOT NULL so `UNIQUE` behaves identically on both
  engines — the same NULL-distinctness divergence that kept `grants` free of a
  triple UNIQUE in the first place.
- **Backfill**: every pre-existing grant row gets `manual(self)`. Unlike 00006's
  tables this is NOT a "no real rows exist" premise — a bootstrapped instance
  legitimately holds grants, and an unfilled row would be a grant no origin
  holds. The fill is the self-grant, which is what the amendment's own wording
  ("every pre-existing grant has exactly `manual(granted_by)`") implies for rows
  that had no granting principal.
- `environments.protected` (NOT NULL, DEFAULT false) and
  `environments.reauth_window_seconds` (NULLABLE). The default on `protected` is
  deliberate and differs from #48's rule for `display_order`: unprotected is the
  real initial state of every environment, so a writer that omits the column
  gets the truth. The window is nullable because NULL means "inherit the
  instance default" — a stored copy of that default would freeze it at creation
  time, and 0 is a legal window value that must never be confused with unset.
- `principals.class` (NULLABLE), backfilled to `automation` for existing machine
  rows. See Deviations for the missing CHECK constraint.

### Store (`internal/store/authn/grants.go`, `internal/store/repos.go`)

Grants live on the **enumerated resolution surface**, following the
credential-reset precedent: `authorize()` reads the grant table to mint a proof,
so a grant write cannot be gated behind one without a cycle. The authorization
gate is the ordinary chokepoint operation the service calls first. New writers
(`AddGrantOrigin`, `ReleaseGrantOrigin`, `DeleteGrantRow`) are named in
`lint.ResolutionSurfaceWriters` and each takes `LockPrincipalRow`.

`lint.CheckGrantLock`'s `grantTable` constant became `grantTables`, gaining
`grant_origins`: releasing the last origin deletes the grant row, so an origin
write is a grant write with one more step and inherits the same serialization
obligation.

The two `project-settings` columns ride the proof-carrying repository surface
(`Environments().Settings` / `SetSettings`), because `environments` is a tenant
table. The reveal guard's READ of the same columns rides the resolution surface
(`EnvironmentReauthSettings`), because it runs beside session resolution before
any operation proof exists.

### Service

- `internal/service/grants.go` — `Create`, `Revoke`, `ApplyTemplate`, `List`,
  `BreakGlassGrant`. Every refusal rule is its own sentinel so a test can assert
  WHICH rule fired.
- `internal/service/settings.go` — `ProjectSettings.GetEnvironment` /
  `SetEnvironment`, `ProtectedWindowCap`, `DefaultReauthHardCap`, and
  `effectiveWindow` — the ONE rule turning stored settings into the window the
  reveal guard enforces, shared by the writer here and the reader in
  `effectiveReauthWindow`.
- `internal/service/reauth.go` — `effectiveReauthWindow` now performs the
  per-environment read #54 left as a seam. The seam test
  (`TestReauthWindowSeamIsSingleSource`) still holds: `s.ReauthWindow` is read
  in exactly one place.
- `internal/service/bootstrap.go` — the first administrator's grants now carry
  their `manual(self)` origins.

### Registry + audit

Sixteen new operations, one per addressed depth per verb (the house pattern from
`audit.query-*` and `credential-reset.*`), plus `environment.settings-read` /
`environment.settings-update`. Nine new audit types: `grant.created`,
`grant.modified`, `grant.revoked`, `grant.template_applied`,
`grant.membership_read`, `settings.reauthentication_window_changed`,
`settings.protected_flag_changed`, `recovery.break_glass_grant` — and
`auth.effective_window_lowered` moved from the closure invariant's hard-coded
exemption list onto `environment.settings-update`, which is the caller #54 was
waiting for.

### CLI

`hikyo admin grant --principal ID --capability CAP [--org/--project/--env]` —
host-local, root key required, no network route, naming its target and
capability explicitly, writing a durable recovery record. It mirrors
`hikyo admin reset-credential`'s mechanism exactly (local authority through
`adminAuth`, riding the resolution surface, **no `SystemProof`**), following
#54's precedent — so invariant 11's system-site sets are untouched and
`SiteBreakGlass` stays empty.

### Wire surface — HTTP + CLI

**17 operations across 9 paths under the `access` tag**, one per addressed
depth, because the authorization formula differs per depth and the ADR forbids
"the capability for this endpoint" as a statement. Every operation carries all
five `x-hikyo-*` extensions, and the formula is documented on the endpoint AND
on the verb:

| Path | Verbs | Operations / formulas |
|---|---|---|
| `/instance/grants` | GET, POST, DELETE | `grant.{list,create,revoke}-instance` = `manage-members@instance` |
| `/instance/grants/template` | POST | `grant.template-instance` = `manage-members@instance` |
| `/orgs/{org}/grants` | GET, POST, DELETE | `grant.{list,create,revoke}-org` = `manage-members@org` |
| `/orgs/{org}/grants/template` | POST | `grant.template-org` = `manage-members@org` |
| `/orgs/{org}/projects/{project}/grants` | GET, POST, DELETE | `grant.{list,create,revoke}-project` = `manage-members@project` |
| `/orgs/{org}/projects/{project}/grants/template` | POST | `grant.template-project` = `manage-members@project` |
| `…/environments/{environment}/grants` | POST, DELETE | `grant.{create,revoke}-env` = `manage-members@project` |
| `…/environments/{environment}/grants/template` | POST | `grant.template-env` = `manage-members@project` |
| `…/environments/{environment}/settings` | GET, PUT | `environment.settings-read` = `read@environment`; `environment.settings-update` = `project-settings@project` |

**The grant's scope IS the addressed path — never a body member.** A
body-supplied scope would let a caller authorized at one depth write a grant at
another: the whole formula defeated by a JSON field. `internal/server/access.go`
builds the scope from path parameters only.

**There is no `grant.list-env`.** "Who can reach this environment" must include
the org- and project-scoped grants that reach it by inheritance, which an
environment-only listing would silently omit. Listing is served at org, project
and instance scope; the CLI refuses an env-addressed `member list` by name
rather than answering a narrower question.

**Revoke is `DELETE` with `?principal=&capability=`** rather than a body on a
DELETE: the triple is an address, and query parameters are the shape every
intermediary handles the same way.

**MFA declarations**: every grant route declares 403, because `manage-members`
is in `authz.MFAMandatory`; the two settings routes do NOT, because
`project-settings` and `read` are not. The iff is asserted against the registry
by `isolation.TestTenantRoutesDeclareForbiddenOnlyForMFA`.

**CLI** (`internal/cli/access.go`): `hikyo access grant list|add|remove|template`,
`hikyo access member list|remove`, `hikyo project-settings get|set`. Scope comes
from the ordinary per-dimension precedence (`--org`/`--project`/`--env`), and
the DEEPEST resolved dimension picks the route — `--instance-scope` is an
explicit opt-in, because "no org resolved" must never silently mean "grant it to
the whole instance". `access member remove` is a client-side loop over the
per-capability revoke (each revocation its own audited event, as the audit ADR
asks); the honest cost is that it is not atomic, and it reports how far it got —
failing in the safe direction, authority removed rather than retained.

**Mechanical chain completed**: oapi-codegen regen (v2.8.0 pin), `wireRegistry`
+ `wireRoutes` + CLI verb classification, `Verbs` list, CLI golden re-pinned
(`go test ./internal/cli -update` — the diff is 10 added help lines and nothing
else), `audited_exemptions.json` grew the two CLI-transport entries, TS client
regenerated (`pnpm run generate` + typecheck + 4/4 contract fixtures on Node 24).
No formula pin change was needed: the operations were registered in the earlier
increment and the wire slice added no formula.

## Invariant → test map

| Property | Test |
|---|---|
| A2: per-formula matrix generated FROM the registry, both engines | `isolation.TestFormulaMatrix{SQLite,Postgres}` (`formula_matrix_test.go`) |
| A2: a formula without a fixture fails CI — **negative test** | `isolation.TestMatrixPlannerRejectsUnfixtured` (synthetic registry with three unfixturable formulas) |
| A2: every proof-minting operation is covered | `isolation.TestMatrixCoversEveryProofMintingOperation` |
| A2: revocation immediate, no cache | `isolation.TestRevocationIsImmediateSQLite` |
| **The acceptance demo**: grant a template role → watch it expand into independent grants → revoke one → the session dies | `isolation.TestRevokeKillsSession{SQLite,Postgres}` (`runRevokeKillsSession`, one principal, three numbered steps) |
| A2/A3: unauthorized ≡ nonexistent for the grant surface, incl. counts | matrix deny cases assert `ErrNotFound` (tenant) / `ErrUnauthorized` (instance); `runMembershipListing` asserts a refused listing is the uniform 404, never an empty list |
| A3: structural timing control (1 query on a miss at any level) | unchanged `isolation.query_count` subtests (#44) |
| Grant-authority rules (org/instance may grant unheld; project may not) | `isolation.TestGrantAuthority{SQLite,Postgres}` |
| Dedup is the API's job; second grantor = second origin, same row | `isolation.TestGrantDedup{SQLite,Postgres}` |
| Origin release; row dies only with its last origin | `isolation.TestGrantRevokeReleasesOneOrigin{SQLite,Postgres}` |
| Lockout invariant (org + instance; project scope exempt) | `isolation.TestLockoutInvariant{SQLite,Postgres}` |
| Lockout census counts org-or-above only (a project-scope holder is not an org holder); a principal covering the org at two scopes may lose one; the revocation trail records the origin kind released | `isolation.TestLockoutCensus{SQLite,Postgres}` |
| Machine allowlists refuse (11 cases + positive control) | `isolation.TestMachineAllowlist{SQLite,Postgres}` |
| Machine SCOPE bounds: workload env-only, automation project-or-below, one project — through individual / template / break-glass | `isolation.TestMachineScopeBounds{SQLite,Postgres}` |
| Audit lifecycle matches the state transition (no event on a no-op; modified when the row survives; revoked only when it died) | `isolation.TestGrantLifecycleEvents{SQLite,Postgres}` |
| **A2 uniformity through the REAL STACK**: 13 route pairs (the whole access surface), unauthorized-EXISTING vs missing, identical bytes, no count/items | `isolation.TestAccessWireUniformity{SQLite,Postgres}` |
| A3 structural timing measured on the REAL SERVICE PATH: every miss costs the same at any depth, a denial on an existing object costs exactly one query more | `isolation.TestAccessWireQueryTrace{SQLite,Postgres}` |
| The query-observer seam has no production call site | `isolation.TestQueryObserverIsTestOnly` |
| An origin join on an already-effective grant leaves the holder's session alive (with a revoke control) | `isolation.TestOriginAddKeepsSessionAlive{SQLite,Postgres}` |
| Project listing does not read sibling projects (asserted on ROWS, not query count) | `isolation.TestProjectListingDoesNotReadSiblings{SQLite,Postgres}` |
| CLI `project-settings set` is tri-state: a window-only update retains protection | `isolation.runHierarchyDemo` (real CLI) |
| Template expansion into independent revocable rows; org-only `manage-projects`; `operator` seeds no disclosure; wrong-level refusal | `isolation.TestTemplateExpansion{SQLite,Postgres}` |
| Membership surface per capability line with origin chips | `isolation.TestMembershipListing{SQLite,Postgres}` |
| Break-glass: origin distinguishable, durable record, allowlists still bind | `isolation.TestBreakGlassGrant{SQLite,Postgres}` |
| Break-glass has no network route | `isolation.TestBreakGlassGrantHasNoNetworkRoute` |
| Protected caps the window; raising above cap refused; every change audited | `isolation.TestProtectedEnvironment{SQLite,Postgres}` |
| **Wire byte-shape**: refusal and genuine miss are the same status and the same bytes on every grant/settings route | `server.TestUniformNonexistentAtEveryLevel` (the route table grew 13 access routes — handoff 44's deferred response-layer obligation landing) |
| **Counts leak nothing**: a refused listing is the uniform 404, never a 200 carrying `count: 0` | `server.TestRefusedListingLeaksNoCount` |
| **The acceptance demo through the WIRE**: template → membership listing shows independent lines with origin chips → revoke one → session dies (exit 3) | `isolation.runAccessDemo`, driven by the real CLI over the socket inside `TestDemoFlow{SQLite,Postgres}` |
| Grant writers hold the principal-row lock (now incl. origin writers) | `lint.TestGrantLock*`, `isolation` lint invariants |
| Every registered event has a real emitter | `isolation.TestAuditCore*/every_registered_type_is_actually_emitted` via `runGrantLifecycle` |

## Deviations from the ADR letter, stated

1. **`org rename`/`delete` keep `instance-config@instance`.** The ticket asked
   for a reading, not an amendment. Per the locked ADR the closed atom set has no
   org-lifecycle capability, so #48's disposition item 4 STANDS: **an org
   administrator cannot rename or delete the org they administer, and gets the
   uniform 404.** No atom was invented. This is a standing consequence for human
   disposition (below), not a defect in this slice.
2. **Break-glass grants carry a `break-glass` origin, not `manual` — this is an
   ADR AMENDMENT MADE IN CODE, not a settled reading.** Same shape as #54's
   `issued_by='recovery'` fourth issuer: the SCIM amendment's origin
   enumeration is closed at four kinds, and this adds a fifth. It is carried to
   the human as disposition item 4, not presented as decided. The reading
   behind it:
   `manual(granted_by)` names a granting principal whose own authority was
   evaluated; break-glass is by the ADR's own words "the only authorization path
   in the system not evaluated against a grant" and has no granting principal to
   name. Recording it as manual would put a principal's name on an act no
   principal performed and would make the row indistinguishable from an ordinary
   grant on the membership surface — the exact thing an auditor looks for after
   an incident. `break-glass` is added to the closed origin enumeration.
3. **A human revoke releases EVERY origin this surface owns** (manual +
   break-glass), not only the caller's own. Rationale: an administrator revoking
   a capability expects it gone, and a surface where "revoke" sometimes leaves
   the capability held by a colleague's origin is a foot-gun on the most
   security-sensitive verb. Origins the surface does NOT own (`scim`,
   `structural`, `lockout-retention`) are skipped and the row survives; the
   event is still `grant.revoked`, carrying `origins_remaining > 0` and
   `sessions_revoked` so a reader can tell a partial release from a real
   revocation without a second event type. That is the shape #73 needs,
   implemented but not exercisable yet.
4. **Machine `reveal` / `reveal-history` are refused outright.** The ADR admits
   them only under the source-of-truth ADR's explicit per-project operator
   opt-in (`reveal`) and only where a pin requires it (`reveal-history`).
   Neither mechanism exists, so the allowlists ship the fail-closed subset and a
   machine reveal grant is refused BY NAME until #17/#58 land the opt-in.
   Widening the list without the opt-in would hand every automation credential a
   standing decryption capability.
5. **`principals.class` carries no CHECK constraint.** sqlite cannot add one to
   a table this many tables reference, and the dialects must stay structurally
   identical. The closed set is enforced in Go at the grant writer, fail-closed:
   an unclassified machine principal holds nothing (asserted by
   `unclassified_read` in the allowlist fixtures).
6. **Bootstrap's `AdminTemplate` is unchanged** — still an instance-scope
   capability list, not the ADR's org/project `admin` template (the #47
   deviation, unchanged here). It now writes origins. Reconciling bootstrap's
   grant set with the canonical template table would change what the first
   administrator holds and belongs to a decision, not a refactor.
7. **`grant.template_applied` and `grant.membership_read` are registry
   additions.** The audit catalogue's `grant` row names created/modified/revoked
   plus denials. The template event records ONE administrator performing ONE act
   (without it the trail can say ten capabilities appeared but not why); the
   read event exists because the audited-none permit covers only tenant-class
   bare-`read` operations and "who can reveal production secrets" is not one.
   Precedent: `auth.provider_read`, `settings.org_read`.
8. **`DefaultReauthHardCap = 15m` DECIDES AN OPERATIONS-SPEC FOG VALUE.** The
   permission ADR's last line lists "default reauthentication window,
   protected-environment window cap, pin quotas and expiry, grant-count bounds
   per org" as fog owned by the operations spec. The hard cap is that same
   class of value, and the code needed a non-zero one to be correct at all — so
   a number was chosen here rather than left broken. **The ops spec owns the
   number; this is disposition item 5.** What was done and why: the constant was
   introduced and the three
   `hardCap <= 0 → hardCap = effWin` fallbacks were replaced.** This closes #54's
   disposition item 1 as a code fix rather than a doc note: with both the idle
   window and the hard cap at 0, a single-decision (0-window) WebAuthn reauth was
   minted with `hard_expires_at == authenticated_at` and was dead the instant it
   was created — so a protected environment, whose whole point is the 0 window,
   would have been unusable. `ProjectSettings.SetEnvironment` additionally
   refuses (`ErrNoReauthHardCap`) to leave an environment at effective 0 while no
   hard cap is configured, so the state cannot be reached silently.
9. **The ADR's ORG-scope lockout refusal is effectively unreachable on a
   bootstrapped instance, and that is the intended reading — stated rather
   than left implicit.** The org census counts holders AT the org or ABOVE it,
   which is what grant evaluation itself would answer, so an instance-scope
   `manage-members` holder counts for every org. The instance-scope arm of the
   same invariant guarantees at least one such holder always exists, and
   bootstrap seeds exactly one. Therefore, on any instance that came up through
   `hikyo admin create`, the org-scope refusal can never fire: every org is
   administrable by the instance holder.

   This is intent-defensible — an org with an instance member manager IS
   administrable, and refusing there would be the over-refusal the ADR does not
   ask for — and it is why the invariant's two arms are not redundant: the
   instance arm is the one that actually holds the line. The org arm is
   reachable only where no instance holder exists, i.e. a deployment whose
   grants were built by hand rather than by bootstrap;
   `isolation.TestLockoutCensus{SQLite,Postgres}` constructs exactly that state
   (raw-deleting the instance grant) because it is the only way to observe the
   org census at all. **Re-checked after the review's P1 and P2 fixes: still
   true, and now true for the right reason** — before P1 a project-scope holder
   could also satisfy the org census, which would have made the arm wrong as
   well as unreachable.

10. **`effectiveReauthWindow` fails CLOSED at 0 for an environment that does not
   resolve**, rather than falling back to the instance default. Consequence: the
   isolation fixture gained a real `env_prod` row (the reauth ceremonies address
   it), and `ts` widened to microsecond precision so the authn resolver's
   fixed-width `decodeTime` reads grant and origin timestamps.

## Scope cuts (deliberate, not gaps)

1. **`member invite` is NOT built, and it IS in the ADR's CLI surface.** The
   api-cli-surface ADR's verb table, line 75, reads verbatim:

   > `| access | `grant list \| add \| remove`, `member list \| invite \| remove`, `credential-reset` | #15/#16 formulas; CLI surface here |`

   `grant list|add|remove` and `member list|remove` all ship. `invite` does not,
   because no spec anywhere fixes what an invitation IS: there is no
   `invitations` table, no claim flow, no delivery channel, and no expiry
   policy. Building it would lock three product decisions nobody has made. The
   seam #54 named is untouched (`service.ErrNoInvitationPath`). **This needs an
   explicit in/out decision — see disposition item 1.**
2. **SCIM origins** (`scim`, `structural`, `lockout-retention`) are declared in
   the closed enumeration and refused by the writer → #73. The revoke path
   already skips origins it does not own, so #73 adds writers, not semantics.
3. **Restore / recovery-mode grant quarantine** → #76. No seam was needed here:
   the ADR's rule is that ordinary authorization denies everything until an
   operator commits the reconciled set, which is a chokepoint state, not a grant
   surface concern.
4. **No formulas registered for publish / pin / adapter / values-export /
   copy.** Those tickets register their own; the matrix generator is what makes
   their fixtures automatic — a formula registered without an addressable atom
   fails `TestMatrixCoversEveryProofMintingOperation`.
5. **Project deletion's "no protected environment in it" clause is vacuously
   satisfied** and was therefore NOT implemented (a `CountProtectedEnvironments`
   query was written and then deleted). v1 deletes never cascade: #48 already
   refuses to delete a project that holds any environment at all, so a project
   with a protected environment is refused one step earlier. If #48's
   non-cascading delete is ever relaxed, this clause becomes live and must be
   added back — noted so it is closed by name, not omission.

## Disposition items (human)

1. **`member invite` is specified by the ADR's CLI surface and is not built**
   (scope cut 1, which quotes api-cli-surface line 75 verbatim). Decide: build
   it in a follow-up slice with a spec for claim/delivery/expiry, fold it into
   #56, or strike it from the v1 verb set.
2. **Standing consequence, unchanged from #48: an org administrator cannot
   rename or delete their own org** and receives the uniform 404, because the
   locked atom set has no org-lifecycle capability. This ticket deliberately did
   NOT amend the ADR. If the consequence is wrong for the product, the amendment
   is a separate decision.
3. **`grant.template_applied`, `grant.membership_read` and
   `recovery.break_glass_grant` are additions to the closed audit registry**
   (deviation 7). The audit ADR's `grant` and `recovery` category rows do not
   name them; they are consistent with the ADR's intent and with existing
   precedent (`auth.provider_read`, `settings.org_read`), but the catalogue text
   is the human's to amend.
4. **`break-glass` as an origin kind is an ADR amendment made in code**
   (deviation 2), extending the SCIM amendment's closed origin enumeration by
   one. Same disposition shape as #54's `issued_by='recovery'` issuer. Confirm
   the amendment, or fold break-glass grants into `manual` with a reserved
   subject and accept that the membership surface can no longer distinguish a
   recovery grant from an ordinary one.
5. **`DefaultReauthHardCap = 15m` decides an operations-spec fog value**
   (deviation 8). The code required a non-zero hard cap to make a 0-window
   (protected-environment) reauth usable at all — #54's disposition item 1 — so
   a number was chosen rather than shipping a broken gate. The ops spec owns the
   number; confirm or replace it.
6. **Two spelling joins to the closed CLI verb set**, declared additively under
   the ADR's own grammar exactly as #48 declared `rename`/`show`/`reorder`/the
   `folder` family: `hikyo access grant template` (the ADR fixes no spelling for
   applying a role template, and the acceptance criteria require one) and
   `hikyo project-settings get|set` with a required `--env` (the ADR puts
   "project-settings get/set" in the org/project lifecycle group, but both knobs
   are per-environment). **#27/freeze must confirm or rename.**
7. **Serializability of dedup and the lockout invariant is lock-argued, not
   race-fixtured** — same disposition shape as #54's item 3, and the honest
   statement of what holds:
   - Every read-then-write on this surface takes the target's `principals` row
     lock as its FIRST statement — `grantOne`, `BreakGlassGrant` and `Revoke`.
     An earlier draft took the lock inside `CreateGrant`, i.e. AFTER the dedup
     read; with no uniqueness over the triple by design, two concurrent creates
     could both have read no row and both inserted. Fixed before landing.
   - `checkLockout` locks every current `manage-members` holder's row in sorted
     order (sorted acquisition is what makes pairwise locking deadlock-free)
     and then **re-reads the census under those locks**. Counting from the
     pre-lock list was the same class of bug: two revocations of the last two
     holders would each have counted the other as remaining.
   - Postgres write transactions run at **Serializable** (`internal/store/tx`),
     with retry, so SSI is a second net under the locks; sqlite serializes on
     its single writer. The locks are what make the property true independent of
     isolation level rather than dependent on it.
   - No concurrent-revocation or concurrent-create fixture exists.
8. **`access member remove` is not atomic** — it is a client-side loop over the
   per-capability revoke, so each revocation is its own audited event (what the
   audit ADR asks for) but a mid-loop failure leaves the earlier capabilities
   revoked. That is the safe direction to fail in and the command reports how
   far it got. A server-side bulk verb would be atomic but would either collapse
   the per-capability audit events or need a second formula; neither is
   specified. Confirm the trade or spec the bulk verb.

## Two-axis review record (standards + spec), round 1

All nine findings fixed in-slice; none deferred, none disputed.

**Standards**

- **S1 (HARD)** — `hasOrigin` swallowed the origin read error and answered
  `false`, so a failed read became "attach an origin" and surfaced as a UNIQUE
  violation with the real cause gone. It now returns `(bool, error)` and
  propagates; the doc comment claimed it read the membership listing, which it
  never did.
- **S2** — `BreakGlassGrant` re-implemented ~50 lines of `grantOne`. Both now
  share `lockAndClassify` (row lock → class → normative allowlist) and
  `writeGrantRow` (dedup → create → origin attach → generation advance →
  session kill), differing in exactly the two things that differ: the origin
  kind and where the audit event goes. The swallowed error had already lived in
  both copies, which is the argument.
- **S3** — `GrantLinesInOrg` / `ManageMembersHolders` took `domain.OrgID`. The
  proof-signature analyzer walks `Repos`/`ReadRepos` only, so the resolution
  surface escaped it; both now take plain `string`, matching
  `EnvironmentReauthSettings` in the same file.
- **S4** — two stale comments: `internal/store/repos.go` named a
  `CountProtected` method that was written and then deleted (scope cut 5), and
  `internal/server/access.go` said a length mismatch "would panic" where the
  code returns `domain.ErrInvalid` from an explicit guard.
- **S5** — **kept, not deleted, and rewritten as a real clamp.** The arm is
  unreachable only because `ProtectedWindowCap` is 0 today; deleting it would
  make the protected read `return ProtectedWindowCap` unconditionally, so an
  operations spec that ever RAISES the cap would silently widen an environment
  explicitly stored at a smaller window — exactly the environment the flag
  protects. It is now `min(window, ProtectedWindowCap)`, which is the same
  value today, has no unreachable branch to flag, and stays correct if the
  constant moves.

**Spec**

- **P1 (WRONG)** — `ListManageMembersHoldersForOrg` lacked `project_id IS NULL`
  in both dialects, so a PROJECT-scope `manage-members` row counted toward the
  ORG census, contradicting the query's own doc, the test premise and ADR
  §Evaluation 5. Conjunct added both dialects; `annotated_queries.json`
  re-pinned (the hash is the review artifact).
- **P2 (WRONG)** — `checkLockout` excluded the target principal wholesale, so
  revoking one `manage-members` grant from a principal who still held a
  covering one at another scope was refused although the org stayed
  administrable by that same person. It now counts what REMAINS after the
  revocation: `retainsMemberManagement` asks whether another
  `manage-members` grant of the target's, at a different scope, still covers
  the scope in question.
- **P3 (WRONG)** — the revoke event hardcoded `origin_kind: "manual"` while the
  release loop also releases break-glass origins, erasing from the revocation
  trail the one distinction deviation 2 exists to make. It now records the
  kinds actually released, sorted and comma-joined (the `environment_order`
  precedent for a multi-valued trusted-vocabulary field).
- **P4 (GAP)** — `TestRevocationIsImmediate` was sqlite-only; the postgres twin
  now runs from the shared body.
- **P5 (DECLARE)** — the org-scope refusal's effective unreachability is now
  deviation 9, re-checked after P1 and P2.

New regression coverage: `isolation.TestLockoutCensus{SQLite,Postgres}` asserts
the census excludes project-scope holders (P1), that a principal covering the
org at two scopes may lose one of them (P2), and that the revocation trail
records `break-glass` when that is what was released (P3).

## Cross-model review

Reviewed by Codex (`gpt-5.6-sol`, high) R1-R3; findings fixed before merge. R1
returned BLOCKED with 10 findings (2 HIGH, 6 MEDIUM, 2 LOW); the eight code
findings were fixed in-slice, and F10 (`break-glass` as an origin kind and
`DefaultReauthHardCap = 15m`) was dispositioned by the human at the merge gate as
a code-made ADR/ops-spec decision, the same house procedure #54's `recovery`
issuer took. A bare-sentinel defect found while fixing was also closed: refusals
in `internal/service/grants.go` and `settings.go` now wrap domain sentinels
(shape errors `invalid`, post-authorization state refusals `conflict`, an unheld
triple `not found`) instead of rendering `internal`. R2 confirmed eight findings
plus the sentinel fix and left F4 and F5 partial; both closed in that round (the
real-stack pair table grew from 7 to 13 routes with a `SetQueryObserver`
test-only seam measuring the real service path, and the origin-join generation
advance was gated on `out.Created`). R3 was the final verdict round.

**Decisions the review changed (durable):**

- **Machine grants are bounded by scope, not just capability (F1).** Enforced at
  the single `lockAndClassify` chokepoint all three writers share: workload
  grants must address an environment, automation project depth or below, and a
  principal's existing grants fix its one project. Stated limit: #17's credential
  binding that names a machine's project authoritatively does not exist yet, so
  the principal's own grants are today's record; #17 replaces this and the rule
  gets stricter, never looser.
- **Bootstrap seeds the ADR `operator` template at instance scope (F2)**, not a
  bespoke `read`/`reveal`/`reveal-history` bundle; the parallel `AdminTemplate`
  is gone. Creating the first org atomically applies `admin` to the creator
  through their instance `manage-members` authority (amended 2026-08-21), so
  `reveal`/`reveal-history` arrive as the separate seeded grants the ADR asks for
  and no tenant data is reachable by bundle.
- **No legacy-machine backfill (F8).** An unclassified machine principal stays
  NULL and fails closed at every allowlist path until an operator classifies it;
  its existing grants keep evaluating (authorization reads the grant table, never
  the class). Guessing `automation` would have been a migration-performed
  privilege escalation.
- **Adding a second origin to an already-held grant is `grant.modified` only
  (F5)** — no generation advance, no session deletion — because the capability
  was held before and after; the advance is gated on a newly created row,
  symmetric with revoke gating the advance on the row actually dying.

## Pickup notes

- **Adding a capability atom**: add it to `capabilityLevels` in
  `internal/domain/domain.go` (the map IS the closed set — `IsCapability` and
  the grant API's validation both read it), and to a machine allowlist if any
  machine class may hold it. A formula atom outside the map fails the A2 matrix
  planner by name.
- **Adding a role template**: add a row to `templates` in
  `internal/domain/permission.go`. Nothing else needs touching — expansion,
  audit and the CLI all read the table.
- **Adding a grant-surface operation**: register it in `authz.operations` AND
  add its depth to `grantOpsByLevel` in `internal/service/grants.go`; a depth
  with no quartet entry silently falls through to the zero Operation, which
  `Authorize` refuses loudly.
- **The A2 matrix needs no per-operation fixture author.** A newly registered
  formula is exercised automatically. What DOES need attention: a new addressed
  depth needs an entry in `matrixScopes`, and a new atom needs to be in the
  closed capability set — either omission fails
  `TestMatrixCoversEveryProofMintingOperation` with the operation named.
- **Re-pinning fixtures**: `operation_formulas.json` and
  `annotated_queries.json` have no `-update` flag. The throwaway repin test used
  here was deleted deliberately; regenerate by copying the `current:` JSON out of
  the failing test's output, or re-add a temporary test that writes
  `facts.FormulaPins()` and the `lint.ParseQueries` pin list.
- **Adding an access route**: the path decides the scope, so a new depth needs
  a new path, a new operation and a row in `grantOpsByLevel` — not a body
  member. All five `x-hikyo-*` extensions, `wireRegistry` + `wireRoutes`, and a
  row in `hierarchyRoutes()` (`internal/server/contract_test.go`) so the new
  route joins the byte-shape assertion rather than getting a weaker one.
- **Postgres harness**: `grant_origins` drops BEFORE `grants` (RESTRICT FK) in
  BOTH `internal/isolation/harness_test.go` and
  `internal/conformance/conformance_test.go`. A missing entry fails only on
  postgres, with SQLSTATE 2BP01 on the NEXT run's re-migration.
- **Run the postgres leg.** `HIKYO_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN=postgres://hikyo:hikyo@127.0.0.1:5432/hikyo_test go test ./... -count=1`.
  A sqlite-only run is structurally blind to drop-order, FK-restrict and
  isolation-level behaviour.
- **`seedOrigins`** in the isolation harness attaches a `manual` origin to every
  raw-SQL fixture grant. A fixture grant without one is invisible to the
  membership surface (an INNER JOIN onto origins) and un-revokable — which is
  the invariant, expressed as a query.

## Verification record

- `gofmt -l .` clean; `go vet ./...` clean.
- `go test ./... -count=1` on **sqlite**: **616 passed, 0 failed, 30 packages**.
- `go test ./... -count=1` with
  `HIKYO_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN=postgres://hikyo:hikyo@127.0.0.1:5432/hikyo_test`
  (**both engines**): **958 passed, 0 failed, 30 packages**.
- The A2 matrix contributes 163 subtests per engine (one grant case plus one
  deny case per atom, per proof-minting operation).
- `go tool sqlc generate` idempotent; `go tool oapi-codegen --config
  api/oapi-codegen.yaml api/openapi.yaml` idempotent; 3.1 profile + freeze
  fixtures pass.
- TS client: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm run generate && pnpm run
  typecheck && pnpm run test` on Node 24 (per `.nvmrc`) — 4/4 contract fixtures.
  `clients/ts/src/generated/{index,sdk.gen,types.gen,zod.gen}.ts` regenerated.
- CLI goldens re-pinned with `go test ./internal/cli -update`; the diff is 10
  added help lines in `internal/cli/testdata/help.txt` and nothing else.
- `annotated_queries.json` re-pinned after the review's P1 conjunct: the census
  query's hash change IS the review artifact.

### Fixed during orchestrator verification (not by this agent)

Both postgres harness DROP lists (`internal/isolation/harness_test.go`,
`internal/conformance/conformance_test.go`) were missing `grant_origins` before
`grants`, so the postgres re-migration failed with SQLSTATE 2BP01. Caught by the
orchestrator's dual-engine run and fixed in this tree; recorded here because a
sqlite-only run structurally cannot see it — the RESTRICT FK is what makes the
drop order load-bearing, and sqlite's harness recreates the file per test.
