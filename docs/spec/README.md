# Hikyo — Specification handoff (the destination of wayfinder map [#1](https://github.com/Hikyo-Org/Hikyo/issues/1))

This is the build-ready specification set for Hikyo 1.0: a fully open-source, self-hosted control plane for validated secrets and configuration across environments, Docker Compose and Kubernetes first-class. Synthesized 2026-08-06 at ticket [#27](https://github.com/Hikyo-Org/Hikyo/issues/27) from 26 locked ADRs, 5 locked prototypes, and the map's ticket resolutions.

## How this set works

**The ADRs are canonical.** Every decision lives in exactly one locked ADR (or ticket resolution); this spec layer indexes, synthesizes across, and discharges what the ADRs delegated to synthesis — it never restates a decision at length, and where any wording here diverges from an ADR, **the ADR wins and the contradiction reopens the owning ticket** (the standing synthesis rule; never patch silently).

**Amendments are banners.** A locked ADR changes only through the [oss-mechanics.md](../adr/oss-mechanics.md) § Governance procedure: reopen the ticket, cross-model review, record an operative banner in the amended file. Read every ADR **through its banners** — the banner text wins over the body below it. [inheritance-model.md](../adr/inheritance-model.md) is superseded in full by [flat-model.md](../adr/flat-model.md); consume it only through the flat-model ripple register.

**Reading order for an implementing team:** product-requirements → domain-model → threat-model → system-architecture → then per-subsystem as the sequencing reaches it.

## Synthesis obligations, discharged

Every "at synthesis (#27)" delegation in the corpus resolves as follows: exact SCIM/SAML/import/multi-instance spellings and serializations → [api-cli-spellings.md](./api-cli-spellings.md); canonical key grammar restatement → [domain-model.md](./domain-model.md); delegated tunable values (SAML, SCIM, multi-instance, import, GitHub adapter) → [ops-catalogue.md](./ops-catalogue.md) (the ops-spec row-15 numbering collision is reported there, deferred to an editorial amendment); the §3 self-hoster checklist (normative deliverable) → [self-hoster-checklist.md](./self-hoster-checklist.md), **passed, no blocking defect**; UI deltas (GitHub adapter knobs, scanning presentation, git-mode banner, declaration-is-public statement) → [ui-spec.md](./ui-spec.md); everything still unspecified → [open-items.md](./open-items.md), none foundational. One contradiction was found and fixed per procedure: oss-mechanics misquoted the license decision as Apache-2.0 (locked: MPL 2.0) — corrected via banner, [#33](https://github.com/Hikyo-Org/Hikyo/issues/33) reopened and re-closed.

## The 1.0 gate, in one sentence

1.0 exists when every [mvp-boundary](../adr/mvp-boundary.md) §1.2 criterion (plus the four promotion criteria sets) is green as [E2E] on sqlite **and** postgres, [UI] via Playwright desktop+mobile, and [CI] invariants, the backup/restore drill has passed in the native arm64 4-CPU/4-GB cgroup lane with two separate custody secrets ([Marc’s #79 amendment](https://github.com/Hikyo-Org/Hikyo/issues/79#issuecomment-5354009024); physical hardware is optional calibration), the self-hoster checklist re-asserts, and the freeze tag fires — nothing satisfiable by deleting or weakening its check.
