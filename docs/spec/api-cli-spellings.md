# Hikyo — API & CLI spellings deferred to synthesis (2026-08-06)

[api-cli-surface.md](../adr/api-cli-surface.md) is the API/CLI spec's skeleton; several later ADRs joined its closed grammar at declared join points and delegated their **exact spellings** to this document. Every spelling here is bound by the locked grammar (noun-verb families, output classes, print triad, exit codes, parity rules) and by the delegating ADR's constraints; a spelling that would violate either is a defect here, not a licence to reinterpret the ADR. Nothing here adds a verb class, an output class, or an endpoint outside the declared join points.

## 1. SCIM administration ([scim-provisioning.md](../adr/scim-provisioning.md))

Human-session verbs (full UI↔CLI parity: binding CRUD, mapping-table administration, credential mint/rotate/revoke, provisioned directory views; the *wire* endpoints under `/api/v1/orgs/{org}/scim/v2/{binding}/…` are fixed in the ADR and are parity-exempt protocol paths):

```
hikyo scim binding create --org <org> --provider <provider>
hikyo scim binding list   [--org <org>]
hikyo scim binding show   <binding>
hikyo scim binding delete <binding>            # runs the ADR's atomic 4-step teardown

hikyo scim mapping add    <binding> --group <idp-group-id> --template <template>
hikyo scim mapping update <binding> --group <idp-group-id> --template <template>
hikyo scim mapping remove <binding> --group <idp-group-id>
hikyo scim mapping list   <binding>

hikyo scim credential mint   <binding>                    # a NEW credential; several may be live
hikyo scim credential list   <binding>                    # ids + metadata, never token material
hikyo scim credential show   <binding> <credential-id>
hikyo scim credential revoke <binding> <credential-id>

hikyo scim user  list <binding>                           # provisioned directory views
hikyo scim group list <binding>
```

Credentials are **plural and id-addressable**: overlap rotation is mint-new → update IdP → revoke-old, identical authority throughout, per the machine-identity credential model the ADR inherits. `mint` is display-once under the print triad; formula `manage-members(org)` ∧ reauth.

Admin REST resources (ordinary `/api/v1` grammar, proof-carrying): `/api/v1/orgs/{org}/scim-bindings`, `…/{binding}`, `…/{binding}/mappings`, `…/{binding}/credentials`, `…/{binding}/credentials/{id}`, `…/{binding}/directory/users|groups`.

## 2. SAML provider configuration ([saml-sp.md](../adr/saml-sp.md))

Joins the **existing `instance-config` verb surface** — no new top-level verb family. Identity providers are a resource under that family (OIDC providers administer identically; `--kind` selects):

```
hikyo instance-config provider create --kind saml --name <name> \
    --entity-id <byte-exact-entityID> \
    (--metadata-file <xml> | --metadata-url <url>)    # URL fetch runs the fingerprint ceremony
hikyo instance-config provider list
hikyo instance-config provider show    <name>
hikyo instance-config provider update  <name> …
hikyo instance-config provider disable <name>
hikyo instance-config provider remove  <name>
hikyo instance-config provider refresh-metadata <name>   # diff-and-confirm ceremony

hikyo instance-config saml-sp-key list
hikyo instance-config saml-sp-key rotate                 # old active becomes retiring; both publish
hikyo instance-config saml-sp-key retire <fingerprint>   # retiring only; erases the private key
hikyo instance-config saml-sp-key compromise-retire <fingerprint> # active only; replace atomically
```

All under `instance-config` capability, grant-evaluated `InstanceProof`, network path — never the local-admin class. `refresh-metadata` is the ADR's "action on the provider resource". SP keys are instance-wide, so their noun is deliberately a sibling of `provider`, not a provider subresource. Fingerprints are `sha256:` plus URL-safe unpadded base64 of SubjectPublicKeyInfo, so the exact value is safe as one path segment. `rotate` atomically marks the active key retiring and mints its replacement. Ordinary `retire` accepts only a retiring fingerprint; `compromise-retire` accepts only the active fingerprint and atomically erases and replaces it without an overlap window.

Admin REST resources (ordinary `/api/v1` grammar, proof-carrying):

- `GET /api/v1/instance/saml-sp-keys`
- `POST /api/v1/instance/saml-sp-keys/rotate`
- `DELETE /api/v1/instance/saml-sp-keys/{fingerprint}`
- `POST /api/v1/instance/saml-sp-keys/{fingerprint}/compromise-retire`

Provider list/show responses carry a required `warnings` array. Its closed warning codes are `metadata_expires_soon`, `metadata_expired`, `signing_certificate_not_yet_valid`, and `signing_certificate_expired`; each item carries `severity`, the relevant timestamp, a server-authored message, and a certificate fingerprint where applicable. The 30-day metadata threshold is server-authoritative. Provider table output names warnings, JSON preserves the structured array, and the existing top-level `hikyo doctor [--instance REF] [-o table|json]` reports the same server-authoritative items (no second warning calculation and no additional endpoint). Doctor returns success for no findings or warning-severity findings; metadata-expired is error severity and returns the stable refused exit code after rendering the findings.

Identity-protocol endpoints (exception class, per-provider, parity-exempt):

- Start: `POST /api/v1/auth/saml/{provider}/start` (server-mints the AuthnRequest, RelayState transaction and path-scoped initiator binding)
- ACS: `POST /api/v1/auth/saml/{provider}/acs`
- SP metadata: `GET /api/v1/auth/saml/{provider}/metadata` (unauthenticated, documentation-class, pre-auth admission)

Per-provider ACS paths satisfy the validation algorithm's per-provider `Destination`/ACS binding. The initiator cookie is path-scoped to `/api/v1/auth/saml/{provider}/acs`.

## 3. Import ([import-paths.md](../adr/import-paths.md))

One top-level human-only verb `import`; the ADR fixes **three entry modes** — the spellings:

```
hikyo import                                   # wizard: TTY, no source arguments
hikyo import --from <k8s|sops|vault|infisical> --project <p> --environment <e> [selectors]
hikyo import --mapping <mapping.json>          # replay, non-interactive
```

`import` without a TTY and without `--from`/`--mapping` is a hard error. Flag-mode selectors per connector: `--file <path>` (file mode, all connectors); live mode: `--live --namespace <ns> [--name <secret>]` (k8s), `--live --mount <m> [--path <prefix>] [--kv-version <1|2>]` (vault; version auto-detected from the mount when omitted); `--env <slug>` selects the source environment inside an Infisical export; SOPS and Infisical are file-only in v1. Flag mode targets exactly one `(project, environment)` and declares every value `string`. Common: `--out-dir <dir>` for the emitted artifacts (values files under the secret-file discipline: dirfd-parent-checked `O_EXCL`, `0600`).

Phase 2 is the existing pipeline, no new grammar: `definitions plan --file` → `definitions apply --plan`, then `values import --manifest <run-manifest.json> [--overwrite KEY,…]` (the one declared additive input: the run-manifest expected-state precondition; `--overwrite` names an enumerated list of `set`-bucket keys, skip-by-default otherwise).

**Wizard interaction states** (closed enumeration; the wizard is an authoring frontend for the mapping template):

1. Source select + mode (file/live) and credential-presence check (ambient only, never prompted for storage)
2. Source scope walk (connector selectors, bounded per the ops catalogue)
3. Environment mapping — including environments the session will create, declared up front
4. Folder mapping
5. Key review — renames (transform surfaced per rename; hard-stop names require explicit rename), classification (secret default; downgrades explicit per key), types (deterministic suggestions, applied only on accept)
6. Cross-environment reconciliation — one canonical identity/type/classification per key project-wide; conflicts resolved interactively (flag mode fails instead)
7. Collision review — `new | set` buckets; overwrite selection enumerated
8. Trim acknowledgements (values altered by TrimSpace refused unless acknowledged; recorded in the template)
9. Artifact emission + the plaintext-still-on-disk warning

**Mapping template** (`mapping.json`) — the portable record of every *choice*; names/paths/types only, **never values**; committable, replayable. Exact serialization (unknown fields reject loudly naming a version mismatch):

```json
{
  "format_version": 1,
  "connector_contract_version": 1,
  "source": "k8s | sops | vault | infisical",
  "scope": { "namespace": "…", "names": ["…"] },
  "project": "<project-id>",
  "environments": [ { "source": "<source-env-or-null>", "target": "<environment-id>", "create": false } ],
  "folders": [ { "source_path": "…", "target_path": "…" } ],
  "renames": [ { "from": "<source-name>", "to": "<KEY>", "transform": "auto | manual" } ],
  "classifications": [ { "key": "<KEY>", "class": "secret | config", "downgraded": false } ],
  "types": [ { "key": "<KEY>", "type": "string | integer | boolean | enum | url | json", "accepted": true } ],
  "overwrites": [ { "key": "<KEY>", "environment": "<environment-id>" } ],
  "trim_acknowledgements": [ { "key": "<KEY>", "environment": "<environment-id>" } ]
}
```

`scope` is connector-shaped: k8s `{namespace, names[]}` · vault `{mount, path_prefix, kv_version}` · sops/infisical `{file_digest}` (+ infisical `{env_slug}`).

**Run manifest** (`run-manifest.json`) — the bound record of one *run* and the phase-2 **precondition**; value-free, committable. `values import` verifies each occurrence token in-transaction; key movement rejects by name. Exact serialization:

```json
{
  "format_version": 1,
  "connector_contract_version": 1,
  "template": { "digest": "sha256:…" },
  "source_identity": { "kind": "k8s | sops | vault | infisical",
                       "context": "<cluster/context name | VAULT_ADDR origin | export-file digest>" },
  "source_versions": [ { "key": "<KEY>", "environment": "<environment-id>",
                         "version": "<resourceVersion | secret_version>" } ],
  "target": { "project": "<project-id>", "environments": ["<environment-id>"],
              "created_environments": ["<environment-name>"],
              "keys": [ { "name": "<KEY>", "id": "<key-id-or-null>" } ] },
  "definitions_revision": 0,
  "occurrences": [ { "key": "<KEY>", "environment": "<environment-id>", "token": "<server-minted opaque>" } ],
  "values_digests": [ { "environment": "<environment-id-or-name>", "digest": "sha256:…" } ],
  "phase_completion": { "authored": true, "applied": false, "imported": { "<environment-id-or-name>": false } }
}
```

**`values_digests` binds each environment's values file to this run by content.** The occurrence tokens bind the reviewed STATE (that it has not moved), not the plaintext an operator is about to write — and a created environment has no token at all. Without a content binding, two runs targeting the same `(project, environment)` could be mispaired: run B's values imported under run A's manifest, or run A's completion marker stamped for run B. So the manifest records the digest of each writing environment's canonical values file (id for existing environments, name for created ones), and `values import` refuses a values file whose recomputed digest does not match. The digest is deterministic, so a wizard session and a flag run with coinciding choices record the same one.

**Created environments are tokenless.** A wizard session may fan out across target environments including ones it will create (state 3), declared up front as `create environment` lines in the definitions bundle and named — not id'd — in `target.created_environments` (`omitempty`; absent when the session creates nothing). A created environment has no id at phase 1 (phase 1 never writes), so it carries **no occurrence row** and sits **outside the phase-2 precondition**: its per-environment values file carries `environment_name` in place of `environment`, and `values import` resolves the name to its id after `definitions apply`, binds by name, and attaches no precondition — a precondition that reviewed no occurrence for it would reject every key. Its safety rests on the locked manifest-less strict-import path (closed schema + skip-by-default); the accepted residual is that movement in the apply→import window is skipped-and-listed, not rejected-by-name. `phase_completion.imported` keys created environments by name and existing ones by id. Detail: [import-paths.md](../adr/import-paths.md), `docs/handoff/112-import-wizard.md`.

**Connector fixture contracts** (fixed here; byte content pinned when each connector is built): per connector, (a) true-positive mapping fixtures for its named capture format, (b) adversarial-parser fixtures (malformed/oversized/decompression-bomb inputs failing loudly at the named bound), (c) hostile-provider-error fixtures (errors sanitized structurally: keys/paths/bounds/codes, never content). Recorded in [open-items.md](./open-items.md) as an implementation-pinned moment.

## 4. Multi-instance ([multi-instance.md](../adr/multi-instance.md))

Verb spellings already fixed by that ADR's declared #25 amendment: `remote add|list|show|remove`, `remote-credential create|list|show|revoke`. The delegated handoff serialization, restating the locked **three-leg flow** exactly:

1. **Start** — the viewing UI opens the remote's authorization page in a popup with `noopener`: `GET {remote}/api/v1/auth/handoff/start?state=<opaque>&code_challenge=<S256>&redirect_uri=<exact pre-registered callback>&purpose=<establishment|step-up>`. The remote creates a short-lived server-side **transaction** binding state, the exact callback URI, the requesting origin, the PKCE challenge, the purpose, and — once authenticated — the target human. An **establishment** transaction additionally records that no prior session exists (purpose alone licenses issuance); a **step-up** transaction binds the initiating workspace-session id, the exact operation elevated, and (where key-scoped) the environment and enumerated key set. These bindings are server-side transaction state, never URL parameters. The human authenticates with the remote's own ceremonies.
2. **Callback** — on approval the remote redirects **code + state only** to the exact pre-registered callback (the allowlist entry is the `redirect_uri` authority) — a same-origin page of the viewing UI, which hands the result to the shell over a **nonce-named `BroadcastChannel`** and closes. The front channel never carries the artifact.
3. **Redemption** — the shell redeems cross-origin: `POST {remote}/api/v1/auth/handoff/token` with `{"code": "<code>", "code_verifier": "<pkce>"}` → the **workspace session** bearer in the response body (never a redirect fragment, never a cookie; JS memory only).

Transactions are single-use, atomically consumed, expiring per [ops-catalogue.md](./ops-catalogue.md); every handoff path (start, callback, redemption) is classified pre-authentication under the remote's admission limits.

**CORS** (remote side): allowed origins = exactly its configured requesting origins (no wildcard, no `null`); methods `GET POST PUT DELETE`; headers `Authorization, Content-Type`; `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: false` — the bearer rides the Authorization header, cookies never cross this channel, CSRF posture untouched.

Directory and workspace **UI states** are specified in [ui-spec.md](./ui-spec.md) § Multi-instance.

## 5. Canonical key grammar

Restated in [domain-model.md](./domain-model.md) § Canonical key grammar, satisfying import-paths.md's delegation.

## 6. Compose delivery ([compose-integration.md](../adr/compose-integration.md), #63)

The verbs the Compose delivery ticket wires. Both families are **machine-only**:
they accept a credential through `--token-file <path>` or `HIKYO_TOKEN` and
nothing else, and never fall back to the stored human session (`--token` does
not exist; the `--use-human-session` exception is not in this build and is a
refusal). Target resolution is the standard per-dimension chain
(`--instance/--org/--project/--env`, then `HIKYO_*`, then `./.hikyo.json`, then
`--context`) with `hikyo-compose.yaml` folded in **after** it: the config fills a
dimension the chain left unresolved, and a disagreement with an already-resolved
dimension is a hard error (exit 2) naming both sources.

### Verbs and flags

- `hikyo run [--config-only] [--allow-override KEY[,KEY…]] [--project-directory DIR] [--token-file PATH] -- <command> [args…]`
  — fetch, merge into the child environment (fetched wins; a differing collision
  is refused unless the key is named in `--allow-override`), and exec. The `--`
  separates hikyo's flags from the child command and its own flags.
- `hikyo compose render [--project-directory DIR] [--config-only] [--token-file PATH]`
- `hikyo compose sync [--project-directory DIR] [--token-file PATH]` — one-shot:
  the doctor checks, then a conditional render, then `docker compose up -d` only
  when a target's stamp moved.
- `hikyo compose doctor [--project-directory DIR] [-o table|json] [--token-file PATH]`

`hikyo-compose.yaml` gains a top-level `run:` block (`acknowledge_loader_control:
[NAME…]`, the stack-level counterpart of a target's acknowledgement, since `run`
has no target) and an optional `slug` (the state-dir / default-runtime-dir path
segment; `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`).

**Not a documented flag:** `HIKYO_COMPOSE_DOCKER` overrides the resolved `docker`
executable for `compose sync|doctor`. It is a test seam, kept out of the help
text and documented only here and in the package doc.

### `sync` pre-render gate — interpretation of "same checks" (for human disposition)

The ADR says, unqualified, "`sync` runs the same checks before its first render."
This build reads that as: `sync` gates its render on the **local integrity**
findings only — the Compose version floor, `format: raw`, the required stamp-var
form and label, the managed-stamp grammar, generation presence/completeness, the
runtime-dir checks, the docker/catalogue/state fail-closed findings, and the
token/state-dir modes. It **excludes** the server-agreement family
(`server_manifest_drift`, `never_rendered`, `server_stamp_unknown`,
`server_unreachable`) from the gate, because those describe exactly the staleness
`sync` exists to repair — gating on them would brick `sync` on every publish and
on every freshly-provisioned box. The `doctor` **verb** keeps the whole family as
errors: it reports, it does not repair. This is an interpretation offered for a
human to ratify or amend in the ADR; it is not a defensible reading that the ADR
sentence dictates on its face.

The default runtime dir (`/run/hikyo/<slug>` or `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/hikyo/<slug>`)
MUST be tmpfs-backed on Linux (`compose.IsTmpfs`) or `render` refuses; an
**explicit** `runtime_dir` is the operator's call — `doctor` reports
`runtime_not_tmpfs` but the renderer does not block. (Orchestrator disposition.)

### Exit codes

The closed set (0 ok, 1 internal, 2 usage, 3 auth, 4 refused, 5 not-found,
6 unavailable) applies, plus the two child-side codes that `run` alone uses and
that are **not** hikyo's own:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 127  | the command after `--` was not found on `PATH` |
| 126  | the command was found but could not be executed |

On a successful exec there is no hikyo process at all (unix `syscall.Exec`;
Windows spawn-wait-and-exit-with-the-child-code), so the child's own exit status
and signals are the invocation's, untouched.

Notable mappings: a machine credential missing → **3**; the human-session
refusal → **3**; all-or-nothing over undeliverable secrets, loader-control
refusal, merge collision, ARG_MAX overage, an offline-serve refusal (snapshot
expired / rolled back / undecryptable), and a `compose` lock held by another
process → **4**; a transport/5xx fetch failure → **6**; a snapshot save failure
(a silent stale fallback is forbidden) → **1**.

### Stderr strings that are stable surface

`run` and `compose render` print nothing on stdout (`compose doctor` prints its
findings report there; `-o json` is `{status, findings}`). These stderr lines
are part of the stable surface:

- `serving stale from <issued_at RFC3339>, generation <stamp>` — one per served
  target (or once for `run`), on every offline serve. `<issued_at>` is the
  server's issuance instant at sub-second (RFC3339Nano) precision: a snapshot's
  high-water mark distinguishes two issuances within the same wall-clock second
  by their content token, so second-truncation would spuriously refuse a
  publish-then-render inside one second.
- `rendered <target> generation <stamp> → <runtime path>` — a target whose stamp
  moved.
- `unchanged <target> generation <stamp>` — a target whose stamp held.
- `up to date (generation <stamp>)` — per target, when the presented cursor was
  current.
- `target: <resolved> [origin <o>, artifact machine-credential]` — the
  disclosure echo, as every other verb prints it.

## 7. Secret-change approvals ([mvp-boundary.md](../adr/mvp-boundary.md) declared amendment 3, #151)

Policy administration is project-scoped (`project-settings`); the review queue
is environment-scoped. Merge and bypass are NOT their own mutation: they call
the ordinary `values publish` path with the request id, so the reviewed change
set is what commits.

### Verbs and flags

- `approval policy list` — the project's policies.
- `approval policy create --min-approvals N --ttl SECONDS [--covers ENV] [--allow-self-approval] [--disabled] [--approver principal:<id>] [--approver group:<groupId>:<bindingId>] [--bypasser <principalId>]` — `--covers` empty means every environment in the project. `--approver` and `--bypasser` are repeatable.
- `approval policy update <policy> …same flags…` — replaces fields and member sets; bumps the version, invalidating requests pinned to the old one.
- `approval policy delete <policy>`.
- `approval request list` — the addressed environment's requests.
- `approval request approve <request>` / `approval request reject <request>` — cast one vote; consumes a purpose-bound reauthentication ceremony.
- `approval request merge <request>` — publish the reviewed change set (requester only).
- `approval request bypass <request> --reason R` — emergency-bypass the quorum (named bypasser only, requester-owned drafts, current reauthentication).

Creating a request is not a verb: publishing into a policy-covered environment
(`values publish`) with no completed approval answers `202` and stages the
request. All approval verbs are human-session only; a machine credential cannot
administer, vote, merge or bypass.
