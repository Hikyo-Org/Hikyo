# Architecture decision records

The locked design authority for Hikyo. Every non-trivial invariant in the
code cites one of these files by short name — "the encryption-model ADR",
"the permission-model ADR" — and the tests under `internal/isolation/` and
`internal/lint/` enforce the invariants the ADRs name. The ADRs were
synthesised on the `wayfinder-docs` branch and vendored here on 2026-08-19 so
the authority the code cites ships with the code; `docs/adr/` on `main` is the
canonical copy from that date. The frozen UI prototypes the ui-spec refers to
stay on that branch (`prototype/`), as do the research notes' images.

**The sanctioned store→transport alias seam.** `internal/service` exposes a
small set of Go aliases to store-owned types: `AdapterTarget`,
`AdapterConflictEntry`, `AdapterConflictArtifact`, `AdapterRecord`, and
`AdapterMove` in `adapters.go`, plus `RetentionConsequence` in `pins.go`. These
types are intentionally shared with transport mapping instead of restated as
service-owned views. The system-architecture ADR owns the import direction,
and `internal/boundary/boundary_test.go` mechanically forbids handlers from
importing `internal/store`; transport therefore cannot reach the datastore
directly. Piloting service-owned views remains a separate decision
([#516](https://github.com/Hikyo-Org/Hikyo/issues/516) option b).

Read every ADR **through its amendment banners**: the banner text wins over
the body below it. A change that contradicts a locked ADR reopens the ADR
(amendment banner, cross-model review) rather than diverging silently — the
procedure is [oss-mechanics.md](./oss-mechanics.md) § Governance. The
build-ready synthesis across these files is [`../spec/`](../spec/README.md);
`inheritance-model.md` is superseded in full by `flat-model.md` and is kept only
for its ripple register.
