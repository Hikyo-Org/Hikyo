# Hikyo flat value model (ADR, locked 2026-08-06)

> **Supersedes [inheritance-model.md](./inheritance-model.md) in full** (per the [oss-mechanics.md](./oss-mechanics.md) amendment procedure; supersession declared 2026-08-06 in [mvp-boundary.md](./mvp-boundary.md), executed here). The flat model was trialed and adopted during the env-matrix prototype ([#20](https://github.com/Hikyo-Org/Hikyo/issues/20), iteration 31): working with the matrix led the owner to drop cross-environment inheritance and project defaults entirely. This ADR formalizes that decision and carries the **normative ripple register** over every locked ADR whose wording assumed inheritance.

Context: the superseded ADR resolved a `(project, environment, key)` through a layer stack — project defaults at the bottom, a transitive `base` chain, the environment on top — with a three-state presence model (`set | absent | masked`) and a blast-radius guard for edits to shared layers. The prototype showed the cost was paid in the wrong place: provenance UI, drift signals, mask semantics and impact fan-out all existed to make inheritance legible, and legibility was better served by deleting the thing that needed explaining. **Every value is explicit per environment.** Ergonomics that inheritance used to provide (fill many environments at once) are explicit operations instead: declare-into-envs, copy-to, and clone-at-creation.

## The model

- A **Value** attaches to a `(key, environment)` — there are no other layers. The **project-defaults layer is deleted**. The **environment `base` pointer is deleted**.
- **Presence is two-state: `set | absent`.** The `masked` state is **deleted**. "This key must never exist here" is expressed only by the schema's `forbidden_in` ([schema-model.md § Presence](./schema-model.md)) — which survives unchanged and is the stronger form: it changes under schema authority, not per-environment publish authority. "Remove this value now" is clearing to `absent`; with no inheritance there is nothing to silently fall back to, so the superseded ADR's *Delete vs mask* distinction dissolves structurally rather than being re-homed.
- **Resolution is a lookup, not a walk**: `K` resolved in `E` is `E`'s `set` entry, else **unresolved**. No conditionals, no templating, no computed values, no cross-project references in v1 (unchanged stance). Cycle validation, the visited-set defense, the base-graph serialization rule and the chain-depth bound are **deleted with the graph they guarded**.
- **Per-key provenance is deleted from the Resolved snapshot.** The winning layer is always the environment itself — a constant is not information. Explainability is restated on what remains and is strictly stronger: every resolved value is explainable as *"set in this environment at revision N by actor A"* via revision lineage ([revision-model.md](./revision-model.md)) and the audit trail ([audit-model.md](./audit-model.md)). The snapshot keeps its full key→value map and validation verdict.

**Domain-model amendment (amends [#7](https://github.com/Hikyo-Org/Hikyo/issues/7)):** Environment loses its optional `base` pointer; the project-defaults layer is removed; Value presence is `set | absent`; the Resolved snapshot drops per-key provenance. This replaces the superseded ADR's three-state amendment to #7. #7's ticket annotation is updated to point here.

## Ergonomics — explicit fill operations, not layers

Inheritance's legitimate job was "I don't want to type this 4 times." Three explicit operations do that job; none creates an ongoing relationship — **every copy is an independent value**, and editing the source later changes nothing downstream, by design (the cross-environment drift signal was removed deliberately in iteration 31; re-adding one would reintroduce the comprehension cost the flat model exists to delete).

- **Declare-into-envs** — key creation takes the set of environments to give a first value to (iteration 31's declare-into-env checkboxes, alongside `required_in`).
- **Copy-to / bulk-apply** — a per-cell action pushes one value into chosen environments; the row editor's bulk apply is the same operation over several destinations. The authorization formula is [permission-model.md](./permission-model.md)'s locked row, unchanged and adopted here in full: **`reveal(source E)` for current material, `reveal-history(source E)` for historical material, ∧ `reveal(destination E)` ∧ `publish(destination E)`**, plus protected-environment confirmation and the #21 ceremony where a destination is protected, with per-key disclosure audit events. (#20's "secret copy gated on source reveal" is the disclosure half of that formula, not a replacement for it.)
- **Clone-at-creation** — creating an environment optionally bulk-copies from an existing environment: one copy/clone under the same locked formula (destination `reveal` and `publish` evaluated on the environment being created). **Creation preflights the copy**: `config` values copy freely; `secret` values copy only where the source-material gate passes. If any secret that cannot be copied is `required_in` the new environment (a `mode: all` rule — an `explicit` list cannot yet name it), **the creation aborts loudly, naming the keys** — schema-model fixes that an environment is validated and materialized before it becomes fetchable, and this ADR's atomicity rule admits no partially-valid creation. Otherwise creation proceeds and the uncopied secrets land `absent`, **enumerated by name in the creation result**. Never silent, never a reveal bypass.

## Secret re-delivery gate — the occurrence rule, restated

The schema ADR's amendment to the superseded ADR ([schema-model.md § Newly inheriting a secret](./schema-model.md)) closed a laundering path: publish authority alone must never make an environment start delivering secret material the publisher could not read. The inheritance-specific *triggers* die; the **rule survives verbatim as this model's general principle**:

> A publish that causes an environment to **begin delivering a `secret` value occurrence the publisher did not supply** requires **`reveal`** on that key in that environment's scope — **`reveal-history`** where the material is server-reconstructed from a historical revision. Gated on **occurrence identity**, not presence.

**"Supplied" is defined strictly**: the publisher supplied an occurrence iff its plaintext was present in their own request (typed, imported, or staged by them). Server-side duplication — copy, clone, bulk-apply, restore — is **authorized duplication, never supply**; it is lawful only under the gates below.

Flat-model trigger enumeration (closed list; a new mechanism that can re-deliver an unsupplied occurrence must join it):

1. **Copy / clone / bulk-apply** — [permission-model.md](./permission-model.md)'s locked row governs: `reveal(source E)` for **current** material, `reveal-history(source E)` for **historical** material, ∧ `reveal(destination E)` ∧ `publish(destination E)`.
2. **Restore** — re-delivering an earlier occurrence is gated on `reveal-history` ([revision-model.md](./revision-model.md), restated by [#30](https://github.com/Hikyo-Org/Hikyo/issues/30)).

Two superseded or candidate triggers are recorded as **unreachable**, with the reasoning that closes them:

- *"Creating an environment that inherits secret occurrences"* — a new environment is empty; material enters it only through the gated operations above.
- *Lifting a `forbidden_in` over a pre-existing `set` secret entry* — no such committed state exists: [schema-model.md](./schema-model.md) aborts any publish in which a forbidden key resolves to `set`, so a `forbidden_in` can only ever be committed over an environment whose entry is already `absent`. Delivery never started, so lifting the rule re-delivers nothing.

**Boundary: the gate governs supply, not routing.** The rule fires where an *environment* begins delivering material nobody with `reveal` vouched for — a **cross-context** flow, the superseded ADR's original attack (a prod secret inherited into a dev workload the publisher controls). Workload *routing* transitions — creating, reassigning, or releasing a revision pin — are **intra-environment**: they move an `E`-credentialed workload between materials `E` itself delivers, and the disclosure decision for that flow was made **when the credential was granted, under `reveal`**. [machine-identities.md](./machine-identities.md) gates minting and every grant mutation on `reveal(E)` for the newly reachable set, *because whoever controls the workload reads the plaintext*; the standing delegation so authorized is **`E`'s current values, as they change** — grant-scoped, never revision-scoped, re-scoped instantly by grants alone. A pin temporarily narrows delivery inside that envelope; releasing it returns to the envelope's baseline. The "release a pin, read the new secret from a workload you control" sequence therefore widens nobody's reach: control of an `E`-workload is either the very reach a `reveal(E)` holder authorized at grant time (and the next publish or restart delivers current material to it regardless of any pin), or it is workload compromise — and a pin is not, and cannot be, a security boundary against a compromised box that holds a live fetch credential. Requiring `reveal` on release would also reverse two locked texts for no gain: [permission-model.md](./permission-model.md) fixes release at `pin(E)` alone, and [#30](https://github.com/Hikyo-Org/Hikyo/issues/30) fixes release semantics (sole-keeper language, fall-forward). Routing to **non-current** material remains the one disclosure-shaped routing move — the granted delegation covers *current* values only — and it is already separately locked: `pin(E)` ∧ `publish(E)` ∧ `reveal-history(E)` at creation or reassignment ([permission-model.md](./permission-model.md), [#30](https://github.com/Hikyo-Org/Hikyo/issues/30)).

## Publish — affected set, atomicity, pinning

- **The affected set narrows to what was touched.** A value publish affects exactly the environments whose entries it edits — there is no ripple, so the superseded blast-radius computation (downstream by value, provenance, or topology) is deleted, along with provenance-only and topology preview rows. **Schema publishes do not narrow**: [schema-model.md](./schema-model.md)'s locked unit stands exactly — a semantic schema publish **validates, requires publish authorization on, and materializes a new snapshot for every environment in the project** at the new schema revision, even where no value or verdict changes (its pinned schema revision changes, and that is a pinned input). No dependency-analysis shortcut is introduced here.
- **The publish preview is the change review** locked in [#21](https://github.com/Hikyo-Org/Hikyo/issues/21), over the affected set. Secret plaintext in a preview stays reveal-gated (unchanged; `config` shows under publish authorization). Freshness binding survives: a preview is bound to the exact schema and value revisions it was computed against, and is invalidated and recomputed if any advance before apply.
- **Per-affected-environment publish authorization, evaluated immediately before commit** — unchanged in force, trivial for value edits (affected = edited), load-bearing for schema fan-out.
- **The protected-environment flag and its confirmation survive unchanged** ([permission-model.md](./permission-model.md) carries them; copy-into-protected and publish run the #21 ceremony).
- **Multi-environment publishes stay atomic, all-or-nothing.** A publish touching several environments (row editor, schema change, clone) **validates and materializes every affected environment in one transaction; any invalid environment aborts the whole publish** — the blocked-env veto locked in #21. Mixed generations remain impossible.
- **Snapshots pin `(schema revision, own value-entry revisions)`.** The base-graph revision is deleted from the pin tuple. A snapshot's stored verdict stays immutable with respect to its pinned inputs; **delivery reads only committed, valid snapshots**, never live state — unchanged.

## Missing-value semantics — unchanged shape

A key `required_in` an environment that is `absent` there fails **at publish**: the publish aborts, naming key and environment. Save/draft stays free; delivery only ever sees valid snapshots. (Same rule as before with the `masked` clause deleted — `absent` is the only non-`set` state.)

## Bounds & serialization

Deleted: maximum base-chain depth (nothing to chain); the base-graph mutation serialization invariant (no graph to mutate). Surviving, re-anchored here: **maximum environment count per project** and the **publish-work cap** (schema fan-out and multi-env publishes are still attacker-triggerable work) — values stay in the [ops spec](./ops-spec.md); **per-project publish serialization** ([revision-model.md](./revision-model.md)); **environment-lifecycle vs presence-rule serialization** ([schema-model.md](./schema-model.md) — the delete-`E`-vs-add-`E`-to-`required_in` race exists without inheritance).

## Rejected alternatives

- *Project defaults as a creation-time template* (dead live layer, kept as a copy source): adds a structure iteration 31 never tested; clone-at-creation covers the need with an existing operation.
- *Keeping `masked` as an operator-level exclusion*: its two jobs are gone (no inheritance to block) or better held (`forbidden_in`, schema authority). A third presence state would exist only to preserve a distinction the model deleted.
- *Dormant schema structures* (keep `base`/defaults columns unused): dead code intolerance; a structure that must not be used is a bug that hasn't happened yet.
- *A standing cross-environment drift/comparison signal*: removed deliberately in iteration 31; equality across environments is not a health signal in a model where divergence is the point. **Distinct and surviving**: the on-demand `values diff` between environments locked in [api-cli-surface.md](./api-cli-surface.md) — an explicit, authorized, per-invocation comparison under #11's oracle rules (write-presence without the reveal gate, plaintext only with it), not an ambient matrix signal.

## Ripple register (normative)

One entry per locked ADR whose text assumed inheritance. Each **amended** file gets a supersession banner pointing here; entries marked *no change* are recorded so #27 need not re-audit. Rule of reading: where any locked ADR says *inherited / base chain / project defaults / masked / provenance (of a resolved value)*, this register's entry governs.

- **[schema-model.md](./schema-model.md)** — *amended.* (a) § *Newly inheriting a secret*: rule survives as this ADR's re-delivery gate; trigger list replaced by the closed list above; the new-environment trigger is unreachable. (b) Presence reporting and all-or-none groups evaluate over `set | absent`. (c) "A masked required key aborts publish" → only `absent` remains; same abort. (d) § *Defaults*: **there is no defaulting mechanism at all** — the "exactly one defaulting mechanism: the project-defaults layer" sentence is void; the rejection of a schema `default` field stands, now on the simpler ground that no invisible source of values may exist. (e) § *Reclassification*: "live occurrence includes dormant (shadowed) ones" is void — shadowing cannot occur; reclassification re-materializes each environment's own `set` entries. (f) Serialization: the base-graph half of "both prior ADRs require per-project serialization" is void; the environment-lifecycle race and its fix stand. (g) **Every value-layer tuple in its operative algorithms becomes an environment tuple**: group-coupling closure runs over `(group, environment)` pairs; pending-change versions are keyed `(owner, key, environment)`; stale-verdict recomputation, quotas, and revalidation follow — the algorithms are otherwise unchanged (the schema-version rule "carries no layer, pairs with every layer among the selected value versions" reads "pairs with every environment among the selected value versions"). (h) Rejected-alternative prose citing layered inheritance stands as historical rationale.
- **[revision-model.md](./revision-model.md)** — *amended.* (a) Pending changes attach to `(key, environment)`. (b) § *Restore*: the three-way `set(v) | masked | unset` comparison collapses to **two-way `set(v) | unset`**; the masked rows of the resolution table, "restore never weakens a mask", and the flatten-provenance cost paragraph are void. Restore stages plain set/clear against the target environment ([#30](https://github.com/Hikyo-Org/Hikyo/issues/30)'s staging model). "Least-blast" is now structural: the target environment's own entries are the only place a restore *could* write. (c) Write-presence statuses drop `masked`. (d) "Computed on the resolved value, not the layer entry" is trivially satisfied — they are the same thing; the cross-environment recompute case (cell changes because `staging` changed) cannot occur. (e) Snapshot pin tuple per this ADR. (f) Re-validation against current schema on restore: unchanged.
- **[import-paths.md](./import-paths.md)** — *amended.* Collision bucketing "on the resolved state, never the local layer alone" loses its object: local state *is* resolved state. Buckets collapse from `new | locally-set | inherited-set | masked` to **`new | set`**; `--overwrite` applies to the enumerated `set` list; the per-key-consent-only buckets (`inherited-set`, `masked`) are empty by construction and deleted. Phase-1 presence queries return `set | absent`. Everything else (two-phase invariant, occurrence tokens, secret-from-ingestion, per-source rules) stands.
- **[permission-model.md](./permission-model.md)** — *amended narrowly.* The **scope lattice's downward inheritance is grant-scope inheritance (org → project → environment) and is untouched** — different sense of the word, no change. Amended: the closed *dynamically triggered disclosure checks* list is replaced by this ADR's trigger enumeration; the #10 propagation paragraph reads per this ADR (publish authorization over touched + schema fan-out; reveal-gated previews; protected flag unchanged).
- **[encryption-model.md](./encryption-model.md)** — *amended.* The value AAD binds **`env_id`** — **throughout**: the AAD schema table, the "layer_id, not env_id, because project-defaults has no environment" rationale (void with the layer it accommodated), the operations-target-layers prose, and the transplant-resistance CI assertions, whose fixtures move from cross-*layer* to cross-*environment* transplant (pre-implementation, so this is a spec edit, not a migration). The DEK-per-project domain sentence reads "every environment's values and every project-scoped sensitive field". Copy-to and restore re-encrypt into new rows exactly as the never-copy-ciphertext rule already requires — unchanged.
- **[tenant-isolation.md](./tenant-isolation.md)** — *amended narrowly.* Its restatement of the encryption ADR's transplant resistance ("another … layer") reads cross-*environment*; nothing else changes — proofs, chains, scope classes are inheritance-free already.
- **[source-of-truth.md](./source-of-truth.md)** — *amended.* (a) A plan pins `(bundle digest, schema revision, per-environment value revisions)` — the base-graph revision leaves the pin tuple. (b) **The definitions bundle schema drops the per-environment `base` field**; under the closed-schema rule a bundle carrying `base` (or any deleted field) is **rejected at parse**, which is also the whole compatibility story — nothing is implemented, no old bundles exist. (c) `apply` no longer runs a cycle check; there is no graph to validate. (d) The database-authority sentence covers **environment value entries**, not "layer values". (e) The inherited reveal escalation reads per this ADR's re-delivery gate. Pins-block-deletion: unchanged.
- **[api-cli-surface.md](./api-cli-surface.md)** — *amended.* (a) Key groups: the `(group, layer)` closure note reads `(group, environment)` per the schema-model entry. (b) **Clear-to-`absent` gets its spelling**: `values set <key> --clear`, a declared additive join to the closed verb set under #25's own grammar (pre-freeze; no value on argv either way). (c) `values diff` between environments **survives** as the on-demand comparison under #11's oracle rules — see Rejected alternatives for the distinction from the deleted ambient drift signal. (d) Terminology note: the output grammar's "masked defaults" names **display redaction of secret output**, unrelated to the deleted presence state; the spelling stands, the register records the disambiguation for #27.
- **[ops-spec.md](./ops-spec.md)** — *amended.* § 8's chain-depth tombstone resolves to **deleted bound** and its section anchor points here instead of the superseded ADR; § 14's "flat-model amendment ADR outstanding" note is discharged; environment-count cap and publish-work cap survive with their values.
- **[mvp-boundary.md](./mvp-boundary.md)** — *amended.* **C1 and C2 both finalize** (see Propagations — both rows were `⧗` placeholders bound to this lock); the header's interim-state language is discharged.
- **[compose-integration.md](./compose-integration.md), [k8s-integration.md](./k8s-integration.md)** — *no change.* "Fetched values win over the inherited environment" is process-environment inheritance (shell `export`), and "integrity amendment inherited" is ADR-to-ADR language; neither invokes value inheritance. Delivery consumes committed snapshots either way.
- **[audit-model.md](./audit-model.md), [human-auth.md](./human-auth.md), [machine-identities.md](./machine-identities.md), [multi-instance.md](./multi-instance.md), [system-architecture.md](./system-architecture.md), [oss-mechanics.md](./oss-mechanics.md), [threat-model.md](./threat-model.md)** — *no change.* Occurrences of "inherit"/"provenance" are session-window, grant, Go-version, client-claim or prose senses; audited during this ADR's drafting and re-audited under its cross-model review.

## Propagations (binding)

- **[#26](https://github.com/Hikyo-Org/Hikyo/issues/26) — C1 criterion text, finalized here:** *[E2E] Hierarchy Instance→Org→Project→Environment→Folder→Key/Value with full CRUD via CLI and API; a key is defined once per project; classification changes only via the reclassification ceremony; unauthorized access at each level returns the uniform nonexistent shape; **no `base` pointer, no project-defaults layer, and no non-environment value row exists in the schema, the API surface, or the UI**.*
- **[#26](https://github.com/Hikyo-Org/Hikyo/issues/26) — C2 criterion text, finalized here:** *[E2E] Flat model: a `set` entry delivers, `absent` delivers nothing — no fallback source exists; `masked` is absent from schema, API surface and UI; a value publish recomputes matrix signals for exactly the touched environments, a semantic schema publish for every environment; restore stages two-way set/clear; copy/clone/bulk-apply run the locked permission formula (source `reveal`/`reveal-history`, destination `reveal` ∧ `publish`); a clone that would leave a `mode: all` required secret `absent` aborts creation naming the keys; a `required_in` key left `absent` vetoes publish naming key and environment.*
- **[#27](https://github.com/Hikyo-Org/Hikyo/issues/27) — synthesis** consumes this ADR and the ripple register; it must not consume the superseded ADR's body except through the register. Matrix-UI reference remains env-matrix iteration 31; reveal/edit remains #21 iteration 6; revision UI remains #30 iteration 6 — all already flat-consistent.
- **Prototype record:** iteration 31's "excluded" naming note ([#20](https://github.com/Hikyo-Org/Hikyo/issues/20)) is moot — the state it named no longer exists.

## Cross-model review record

Codex `gpt-5.6-sol`, high effort, three rounds per the standing rule. **R1: 1 critical + 12 high, verdict BLOCKED** — all 12 high accepted and fixed (trigger family with the strict "supplied" definition; unreachable `forbidden_in` trigger removed; clone preflight abort; schema fan-out un-narrowed to schema-model's exact locked unit; api-cli/tenant-isolation moved to amended; schema/source-of-truth/encryption register entries extended to their operative algorithms; C1 finalized beside C2; ops-spec tombstones and all ten banners applied). The critical (pin release/reassign as a re-delivery-gate bypass) was **rebutted, not fixed**. **R2: 12/13 verified; the critical held with a concrete attack.** The rebuttal was strengthened on the locked corpus: the gate targets cross-context supply, pin routing is intra-environment, the disclosure decision is [machine-identities.md](./machine-identities.md)'s reveal-gated credential grant, and requiring `reveal` on release would reverse two locked texts. **R3: RESOLVED/SOUND — final verdict CLEAN/SOUND**, confirming no principal's reach widens beyond the reveal-authorized delegation or the accepted workload-compromise boundary, and the full post-R1 text consistent with the locked corpus.

## Declared amendment: bounded fetch-time config parameters (#723, 2026-09-12)

The explicit request to implement #723 adopts its previously post-1.0 scope.
Resolution remains environment-local: only an explicitly stored config value
may contain `${NAME}` references to declared public environment parameters.
No cross-key references, inheritance, defaults, conditions, functions or recursive
evaluation are introduced. Secret values remain literal. The implementation
bounds declarations to 32, names to 64 bytes, patterns to 512 bytes and supplied
values to 256 UTF-8 bytes without control characters. RE2 patterns match whole
inputs. Unknown, missing and invalid parameters refuse the entire delivery.

Upgrade compatibility: template interpretation is opt-in per environment, enabled
only when its next publication captures at least one parameter declaration.
Zero-declaration environments retain literal `${` and `$${` bytes, including on
future publications after upgrade. With templating enabled, `$${` escapes a
literal `${`. Any dollar immediately before `${` escapes that opening, so
`$$${NAME}` delivers literal `$${NAME}`; dollars elsewhere are unchanged. The
grammar cannot prefix a resolved reference with an adjacent literal dollar.
Adding the first declaration requires escaping existing literal
openings before publication. Frozen old snapshots retain their old behavior.
Owner draft advisories expose `validation_deferred` for caller-dependent config
schema checks. Structural validity is not a guarantee for all parameter inputs;
escaped-only literals receive complete validation before publication.
Stored contracts use semantic version 1, tolerate additive metadata at that
version, and fail closed on unknown versions. Contracts with nonempty declarations
or schemas require version 1. Pre-feature empty `{}` contracts keep all values
literal. New semantic requirements must advance the version.

Parameter declaration edits require project definitions-edit, serialize under
the project lock, and advance definitions revision. They are database-managed
metadata for the next publication only, not included in definitions bundles.
Normal publication captures declarations and config validation schemas in an
immutable snapshot contract under the existing publish, protection and approval
rules. Publish validates reference syntax and membership; fetch validates the
substituted complete config against the captured schema and render limits.
Historical delivery uses its historical contract. No partial values leave on a
failure. Copy/clone authority remains unchanged; copied templates require the
destination's own declarations before publication.

Snapshot browsing tokens identify stored templates. Parameterized delivery tokens
bind canonical public input maps plus resolved manifests. Conditional cursors and
operator keyed stamps move when inputs change, including unused inputs. Empty
input maps preserve ordinary legacy tokens. Delivery access events record public
inputs; per-value disclosures reference those events. Each successful parameterized export emits one `disclosure.values_exported` event
with those inputs and ordinary credential-pattern audit redaction. Ordinary
config-only exports remain unaudited; secret per-value disclosures are unchanged.

Supported parameter consumers are CLI values export and the Kubernetes operator.
Consumers without parameter inputs fail closed rather than publishing literal
unresolved templates. Different parameter sets share this environment's secrets,
grants and publication history; independent secrets require separate environments.
