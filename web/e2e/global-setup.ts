/**
 * Global setup runs the registry's closure check FIRST, before a browser
 * starts. A suite that is missing a flow should say so in two seconds, not
 * after it has finished passing every flow it does have.
 *
 * ONE instance per invocation, and therefore one instance shared by every
 * project a single invocation runs. That matters: flows mutate the instance , 
 * `instance-admin` creates an organisation, so a run covering both viewport
 * projects at once has the first project's writes visible to the second, and
 * an assertion about how many organisations exist fails for a reason that is
 * not the code. `pnpm run e2e` therefore invokes each project separately, the
 * same shape CI's per-viewport sharding gives it.
