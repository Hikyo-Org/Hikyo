 * The fixture tenant the reveal flow needs (#58).
 *
 * It is seeded through the REAL API with a real session, never by writing to
 * the datastore: a value is a sealed envelope bound to its own row, and a
 * fixture that inserted bytes directly would produce cells nothing can open —
 * a flow that then "passed" would be proving something about a broken row.
 *
 * Two capabilities on the seeding path are MFA-mandatory (`instance-config`
 * creates the org, `reveal` is the one under test), so the seeding session
 * enrols TOTP and steps up.
 *
 * The TOTP code is computed here rather than pulled from a library. It is
 * FIXTURE-GRADE and deliberately so: the product's own TOTP lives in
 * `internal/crypto/totp.go` and is not reachable from Node, there is no
 * TypeScript equivalent anywhere in this repo to reuse, and RFC 6238 with the
 * server's fixed parameters (SHA-1, six digits, 30-second steps) is a dozen
 * lines of `node:crypto`. Adding a dependency to a test harness for that is a
 * dependency to audit and pin forever. It is checked against the RFC's own
 * vectors, and it authenticates nothing in production.
 *
 * Every response crosses a Zod schema before anything reads it, exactly as the
 * SPA's own client does: a fixture that trusted `resp.json()` would fail three
 * frames from the mistake, in setup, where the message matters most.
