/**
 * TWO real Hikyo instances for the flow suite.
 *
 * The flows run against the GO BINARY serving the embedded SPA, never against
 * a Vite dev server. That is not fussiness: the serving rules, the CSP, the
 * `__Host-` cookies, the CORS echo and the CSRF contract are all part of what
 * the flows are there to prove, and a dev server implements none of them.
 *
 * Both instances are `--dev` zero-config sqlite ones in fresh temp directories,
 * bootstrapped exactly the way an operator does it — `hikyo admin create` on the
 * host, then the credential established with the authority it minted. No seeded
 * password, no fixture user inserted behind the API's back, and no assurance
 * handed out that was not demonstrated: every instance-scope surface is
 * MFA-mandatory, so a password-only session could not open the remotes page at
 * all.
 *
 * ## Why two hosts and not two ports
 *
 * A(viewing) is `http://localhost:PORT_A` and B(serving) is
 * `http://127.0.0.1:PORT_B`, and the differing HOSTNAME is load-bearing:
 * cookies are not partitioned by port, so two instances on one hostname would
 * share `__Host-hikyo` and B's login would silently destroy A's session. Two
 * loopback names are two cookie jars, two origins, and a real cross-origin arc.
 *
 * WHICH name goes where is not free, and it is a WebAuthn constraint rather
 * than a preference: the relying-party id must be a registrable domain and an
 * IP literal is not one, so a passkey ceremony against a loopback ADDRESS is
 * refused by the browser before the server sees it. A is where the shared
 * passkey session lives and where the reveal flow's ceremonies run, so A takes
 * `localhost`. B authenticates with a password and a real TOTP factor only, so
 * the address literal is fine there.
 *
 * ## Why the browser leg is http (decision, #71)
 *
 * `service.CanonicalOrigin` accepts http so a loopback ORIGIN is representable
 * as an allowlist entry, while `remotefetch.ValidateRemoteURL` refuses plaintext
 * so a REMOTE URL never is. That asymmetry is deliberate in the product and the
 * harness leans on it: what the browser leg proves — popup on the remote's
 * origin, CORS, `noopener` + BroadcastChannel, header-borne bearer, the kill
 * switch — is ORIGIN-shaped, not pin-shaped, so http loopback exercises it
 * honestly and no certificate exception is needed anywhere. The pinned TLS half
 * is proven where it belongs, in `internal/isolation/two_instance_test.go`,
 * against two real routers over real TLS.
 *
 * The one seam that falls out of that decision is `repointRemoteAtB` below: an
 * entry can only be CREATED over https (correctly), so it is created through the
 * real API against a pinned TLS front that proxies B's own directory, and then
 * repointed at B's loopback http origin for the browser leg. The credential is
 * really sealed, the snapshot is really B's, and the card lands in the
 * `unreachable — last known` state, which is itself one of the states the
 * directory card owes a human.
