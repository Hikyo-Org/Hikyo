/**
 * The closed flow registry (mvp-boundary S3).
 *
 * The 1.0 gate requires that every locked surface has a Playwright flow. That
 * only means something if it is CHECKED, and only stays true if the check
 * cannot be satisfied by editing the check — so the surface list is the
 * router's own (`src/app/navigation.ts`), which a new route has to touch, and
 * the closure test below fails when the two disagree in either direction:
 *
 *   - a surface with no flow  — the gate's actual requirement;
 *   - a flow naming a surface that does not exist — a rename that left a
 *     registry entry pointing at nothing, which would silently reduce
 *     coverage while looking complete;
 *   - a registry entry whose spec file is missing — same, one level down;
 *   - a claimed surface the pinned assertion set never actually RAN on. A
 *     declaration-only check is satisfied by adding three lines and asserting
 *     nothing, so the flows record what they execute and the run log below is
 *     compared against the claims at teardown.
 *
 * Adding a locked surface from here on therefore fails CI until its flow
 * lands. That is the point of the ticket.

// CI parallelism does not change what the log MEANS. It splits the flows across
// matrix legs, one runner per (viewport project, flow group), so each leg's log
// is partial by design and its teardown skips the execution check. The
// `web-closure` job concatenates every leg's log and runs `unexecutedClaims`
// over the whole thing (e2e/check-closure.ts): for EVERY project that appears
// anywhere in the merged log, every flow/surface/theme claim must appear for
// that same project, so one complete viewport can never conceal a partial
// second one. The append stays single-writer PER LEG; the aggregator merges the
// legs by concatenation, which needs no coordination. A `--shard` split is
// still refused by global teardown — it fragments the flows without the
// positional-filter marker the skip is keyed on.
