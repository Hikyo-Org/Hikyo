/**
 * The SERVING instance's authorization page (registry surface
 * `workspace-approve`).
 *
 * This is the page the popup lands on, served by the instance being operated,
 * on that instance's own origin. Everything about the human's authentication
 * happens here and only here: this instance's password, its TOTP, its passkeys,
 * its OIDC — never the viewing instance's, which has no way to authenticate to
 * this one and no code path that could.
 *
 * Two shapes land here, distinguished by the `purpose` the transaction was
 * opened under:
 *
 *  - **establishment** — a first workspace. The human is signed in (or signs in
 *    here, in place) and approves; the redemption mints a workspace session.
 *  - **step-up** — an ELEVATION of a workspace already open. A disclosure over
 *    there needs a fresh reauthentication over here first, so the human runs
 *    THIS instance's own #58 ceremony over the bound environment — which opens
 *    the reauth window the approval's server-side freshness gate then requires —
 *    and only then approves. The page reads purpose, environment and key set
 *    from the server-owned transaction by opaque state; the server validates
 *    the fresh window against that same bound environment.
 *
 * Three details are load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. **It renders the sign-in form itself when there is no session.** A first
 *     establishment arrives with no cookies for this instance, and redirecting
 *     to `/login` would drop the `state` this transaction is addressed by.
 *  2. **Approval is an ordinary same-origin, cookie-authenticated POST** with
 *     the synchronizer token — the shared client's rules, unchanged. Nothing
 *     the viewing origin sent is trusted here beyond the opaque state value,
 *     which the server resolves against its own transaction row.
 *  3. **The redirect target comes from the SERVER**, never from the URL. The
 *     callback authority is the allowlist entry the transaction was opened
 *     against; a redirect URI supplied by whoever opened this page would be an
 *     open redirector with a fresh authorization code attached.
