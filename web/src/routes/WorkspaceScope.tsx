 * either way; what changes is the transport under them, and this is where that
 * swap is made. A surface reached with a `?remote=<name>` query parameter is
 * operating that remote; without one it is local, and this renders its children
 * untouched so nothing about the local path changes.
 *
 * The remote is a QUERY PARAMETER rather than a new route on purpose: the
 * closed surface registry (`app/navigation.ts`) gates every path on a Playwright
 * flow, and the workspace is the SAME matrix/values/history the flow already
 * covers, pointed elsewhere — not a second set of surfaces to register and
 * assert twice over. The deep link that carries the parameter is built from a
 * live read of the remote's own project list, so its org and project ids are
 * the remote's, resolved over the bearer, never guessed from the directory
 * snapshot's names.
