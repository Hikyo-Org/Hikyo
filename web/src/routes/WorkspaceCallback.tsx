/**
 * The viewing instance's own callback page (registry surface
 * `workspace-callback`).
 *
 * This is the return leg of the front channel and it does exactly three things:
 * read `code` and `state` off its own URL, broadcast them on the transaction's
 * nonce-named channel, and close itself.
 *
 * It exists at all because the popup is opened with `noopener`: a hostile or
 * compromised remote must not be able to navigate the opener into a phishing
 * page, so `window.opener` is null and there is nothing to post a message
 * back through. A same-origin page plus a `BroadcastChannel`, which only this
 * origin's documents can open, is the return path that costs nothing.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do: redeem. The front channel carries code and
 * state only; the artifact is redeemed by the SHELL, with the PKCE verifier
 * that never left it, and lands in that document's memory rather than this
 * one's.
