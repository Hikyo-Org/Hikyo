 * The platform gives a real focus trap, an inert document behind it, Escape and
 * the top layer, every part of which a hand-rolled `role="dialog"` has to
 * reimplement, and the focus trap is the part everyone gets wrong. The close on
 * unmount is what makes focus RESTORATION real: the platform returns focus to
 * the element that was focused before `showModal()` only when the dialog is
 * closed, and a dialog that is simply removed from the tree while open leaves a
 * keyboard user on `<body>`. Callers that want to be asked before closing keep
 * using `onCancel`; this only covers the unmount.
