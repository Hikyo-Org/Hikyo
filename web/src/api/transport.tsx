 * the ONE mechanism by which the exact same product view operates a remote: the
 * api-wrapper hooks read the transport from this context and spread it into
 * their SDK options. Outside a workspace the context is null and the spread is
 * empty, so the singleton is used and nothing about local behaviour changes.
 *
 * There is deliberately no server in this path and no way to add one: the
 * override is a browser-side origin swap, and `api/noproxy_test.go` keeps the
 * viewing server from ever growing an endpoint that would proxy a remote.
