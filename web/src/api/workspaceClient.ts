/**
 * The workspace tier's DATA transport (#71, multi-instance ADR § What the
 * workspace is, and is not).
 *
 * The shell renders a remote's data with its OWN components against the
 * remote's ordinary `/api/v1`, the same generated SDK the shell uses on
 * itself, pointed at another origin. That redirection is this file: a second
 * hey-api client, one per remote origin, that the api-wrapper hooks pass as
 * `options.client` so the exact same `listValues`/`setValue`/`revealValue`
 * call talks to the remote instead of home.
 *
 * It shares NOTHING with the same-origin singleton in `client.ts`, and the
 * differences are load-bearing, not stylistic:
 *
 *   - `credentials: 'omit'`, the workspace bearer rides an `Authorization`
 *     header precisely so cookies never cross the origin. Omit is what keeps
 *     the remote's CORS out of credentials mode and its CSRF posture untouched.
 *   - NO synchronizer-token interceptor, that token is a cookie-session
 *     defence and there is no cookie here; echoing this instance's CSRF token
 *     to a foreign server would leak it for nothing.
 *   - the bearer is read from the LIVE store at request time, never captured at
 *     client creation, a reconnect (or a step-up, which rotates the bearer in
 *     place) must be picked up by the very next call, not stranded behind a
 *     value frozen when the client was built.
