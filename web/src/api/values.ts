 * are contract-bearing even though the browser treats the middle of the

 * one that is easy to get subtly wrong: **the window gates the prompt, never
 * the check**. So a refusal from a disclosure route is NOT read as "the window
 * lapsed, prompt again". A 403 there means the server refused the disclosure —
 * most often a grant revoked under an open window — and the honest response is
 * to remask and say so, not to loop the human through a ceremony that will
