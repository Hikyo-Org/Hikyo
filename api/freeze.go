// The freeze gate (api-cli-surface ADR § Version promise).
//
// "The freeze is a CI invariant, not a doc sentence": once the freeze tag
// exists, the pipeline diffs api/openapi.yaml against the immutable freeze
// commit with a full structural diff, FAIL-CLOSED OVER AN ALLOWLIST of
// permitted addition change-types. Any change id not on the allowlist — a
// change oasdiff classes below "breaking", or one a future oasdiff version
// introduces — is a red build.
//
// Trusting oasdiff's own breaking/non-breaking taxonomy was considered and
// rejected: it classes some forbidden changes as warning or info, notably
// removals after a deprecation window this promise does not offer. Severity
// is oasdiff's opinion; the allowlist is Hikyo's policy.
//
// The freeze-guard CI job is armed against the v1.0.0 tag. Until that tag
// exists it reports a documented dormant success; after the tag is cut it
// loads api/openapi.yaml from that immutable commit and applies this gate to
// every proposed revision.

// PermittedChanges is the fail-closed allowlist: the oasdiff change ids that
// count as permitted additions under the version promise.
//
// The promise is: new endpoints, new OPTIONAL request fields, new response
// fields, and growth of enums declared open. Everything else — including
// anything oasdiff invents in a future release — is refused until reviewed
// and added here deliberately.
